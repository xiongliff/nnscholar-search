    "abstract": "Right ventricular (RV) function has a well-established prognostic role in patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) undergoing transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) and is typically assessed using echocardiography-measured tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion. Recently, a deep learning model has been proposed that accurately predicts RV ejection fraction (RVEF) from 2-dimensional echocardiographic videos, with similar diagnostic accuracy as 3-dimensional imaging. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the deep learning-predicted RVEF values in patients with severe MR undergoing TEER. This multicenter registry study analyzed the associations between the predicted RVEF values and 1-year mortality in patients with severe MR undergoing TEER. To predict RVEF, 2-dimensional apical 4-chamber view videos from preprocedural transthoracic echocardiographic studies were exported and processed by a rigorously validated deep learning model. Good-quality 2-dimensional apical 4-chamber view videos could be retrieved for 1154 patients undergoing TEER between 2017 and 2023. Survival at 1 year after TEER was 84.7%. The predicted RVEF values ranged from 26.6% to 64.0% and correlated only modestly with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (Pearson R=0.33; P<0.001). Importantly, predicted RVEF was superior to tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion levels in predicting 1-year mortality after TEER (area under the curve, 0.687 versus 0.625; P=0.029). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that patients with reduced RV function (n=723; defined as a predicted RVEF of <45%) had significantly worse 1-year survival rates than patients with preserved RV function (n=431; defined as a predicted RVEF of ≥45%; 80.3% [95% CI, 77.4%-83.3%] versus 92.1% [95% CI, 89.5%-94.7%]; hazard ratio for 1-year mortality, 2.67 [95% CI, 1.82-3.90]; P<0.001). Deep learning-enabled assessment of RV function using standard 2-dimensional echocardiographic videos can refine the prognostication of patients with severe MR undergoing TEER. Thus, it can be used to screen for patients with RV dysfunction who might benefit from intensified follow-up care.",

    "abstract": "Patients with abnormal (positive) exercise electrocardiography, but normal stress echocardiography (+ECG/-Echo), have an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events compared with patients with a normal (negative) ECG and a normal stress Echo (-ECG/-Echo). However, it is unclear if +ECG/-Echo discordance is associated with a greater burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis. Project Baseline Health Study participants who underwent a stress Echo and coronary artery calcium (CAC) scan were stratified by stress Echo result: -ECG/-Echo or +ECG/-Echo. Multivariable regression investigated the association between stress Echo results and CAC burden. Event-free survival from a composite of adverse cardiovascular events was compared between groups. Among 1630 asymptomatic participants in this observational cohort study, 1503 (92.2%) had a -ECG/-Echo, 105 (6.4%) had a +ECG/-Echo, and 22 (1.3%) had a +Echo. The +ECG/-Echo group had a significantly greater burden of coronary atherosclerosis than the -ECG/-Echo group (mean CAC score, 198±470 versus 53±186; P<0.001; CAClog, 2.2±2.7 versus 1.2±2.0; P<0.001). The -ECG/-Echo group was more likely to have CAC=0 compared with the +ECG/-Echo group (65.9% versus 53.3%; P=0.01), whereas the +ECG/-Echo group more commonly had CAC ≥100 (28.6% versus 11.4%; P<0.001). After adjustment, CAClog scores were 52% higher in the +ECG/-Echo group than in the -ECG/-Echo group (P=0.002). Compared with the -ECG/-Echo group, the +ECG/-Echo group was 4.5× more likely to have a CAC score ≥400 (adjusted odds ratio, 4.54 [95% CI, 1.95-10.05]; P<0.001). After a median follow-up of 4.3 years, a trend toward increased adverse cardiovascular events was observed among participants with +ECG/-Echo. Individuals with a +ECG/-Echo have a higher burden of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis than those with a -ECG/-Echo, which may explain, at least in part, the increased risk for adverse cardiac events in this population. Further study is needed to determine the optimal strategy for mitigating cardiovascular risk in these patients. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03154346.",

    "abstract": "In patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), the impact of type 2 diabetes (T2D) on left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) and its prognostic implications remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate LV function using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) speckle-tracking echocardiography in patients with HFpEF with and without T2D, and to investigate its prognostic significance. A total of 335 patients with HFpEF were prospectively enrolled for echocardiographic evaluation. LV GLS was obtained using 2D- and 3D-speckle-tracking echocardiography. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine predictors of adverse outcomes. The C-index, Akaike information criterion, integrated discrimination improvement, and net reclassification improvement were used to assess model performance and discriminative ability. LV 2D-GLS and 3D-GLS were impaired in patients with HFpEF and T2D compared with those without T2D. After a median follow-up of 17.6 months, 150 patients experienced adverse outcomes. Both 2D-GLS (hazard ratio, 1.323 [95% CI, 1.225-1.429]; P<0.001) and 3D-GLS (hazard ratio, 1.412 [95% CI, 1.316-1.515]; P<0.001) were independent predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with HFpEF after adjustment for confounders. The predictive accuracy of a model incorporating 3D-GLS (Akaike information criterion=-583.9, C-index=0.775 [95% CI, 0.742-0.808]) was superior to models using 2D-GLS (Akaike information criterion=-533.3, C-index=0.719 [95% CI, 0.678-0.760], ΔC-index=0.056; P=0.034) and LV ejection fraction (Akaike information criterion=-498.9, C-index=0.659 [95% CI, 0.610-0.708], ΔC-index=0.116; P<0.001). The addition of 2D-GLS and 3D-GLS to the base model significantly enhanced its discriminatory and predictive abilities (integrated discrimination improvement=0.225 and 0.280; net reclassification improvement=0.612 and 0.734, respectively, P<0.001 for all). LV 2D-GLS and 3D-GLS are impaired in patients with HFpEF and T2D, and are independent predictors of adverse outcomes. Moreover, 3D-GLS provides incremental prognostic value over 2D-GLS.

    "abstract": "Disorders of the pulmonic valve (PV) receive considerably less attention than other forms of valvular heart disease. Due to the dramatically improved survival of children with congenital heart disease over the last 5 decades, there has been a steady increase in the prevalence of adults with congenital heart disease, which necessitates that clinicians become familiar with the anatomy and the evaluation of right ventricular outflow tract and PV anomalies. A multimodality imaging approach using echocardiography, cardiac computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging is essential for a comprehensive evaluation of the anatomy and function of the right ventricular outflow tract, PV, and supravalvular region. As clinical presentation is often insidious with nonspecific symptoms, yet morbidity and mortality associated with severe untreated PV disease are significant, a high index of suspicion coupled with appropriate use of imaging techniques is critical in facilitating timely diagnosis and treatment. In this review, we aim to present a comprehensive approach to the diagnosis of PV disease and associated right ventricular outflow tract or supravalvular pulmonary stenosis, including optimal use of multimodality imaging to facilitate timely diagnosis, optimize therapeutic strategies, enhance postprocedural surveillance, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Aortic valve calcification (AVC) has been shown to be a powerful assessment of aortic stenosis (AS) severity and a predictor of adverse outcomes. However, its accuracy in patients with low-flow AS has not yet been proven. The objective of the study was to assess the predictive value of AVC in patients with classical low-flow (CLF, that is, low-flow reduced left ventricular ejection fraction) or paradoxical low-flow (PLF, that is, low-flow preserved left ventricular ejection fraction) AS. We prospectively included 641 patients, 319 (49.8%) with CLF-AS and 322 (50.2%) with PLF-AS, who underwent Doppler echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography. AVC ratio (AVCratio) was calculated as AVC divided by the sex-specific AVC threshold for AS severity; AVC score ≥2000 Agatston units in male patients and ≥1200 Agatston units in female patients. The primary end point of the study was all-cause mortality regardless of treatment. Sex-specific AVC thresholds identified AS severity correctly in 137 (87%) of the patients. During a median follow-up of 4.9 (4.3-5.9) years, there were 265 deaths. After comprehensive adjustment, AVCratio was associated with all-cause mortality in patients with CLF-AS (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.01-1.56]; P=0.046) and PLF-AS (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.14-2.00]; P=0.004). There was an interaction (P=0.001) between AVC and AS flow patterns (ie, CLF versus PLF) with regard to the prediction of mortality. The best AVCratio threshold to predict mortality was different in patients with CLF-AS (AVCratio ≥0.7) and PLF-AS (AVCratio ≥1). After a comprehensive analysis, AVCratio as a dichotomic variable was associated with all-cause mortality in all groups (P≤0.001). The addition of AVCratio to the models improved all models' predictive value (all net reclassification index >18%; all P≤0.05). In patients with CLF-AS or PLF-AS, AVC is a major predictor of mortality. Thus, AVC should be used in low-flow patients to assess AS severity and stratify risk. Importantly, in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, a nonsevere AS (ie, AVC 70% of severe) could be associated with reduced survival.",

This can manifest as a multitude of pathologies including left ventricular dysfunction, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, accelerated atherosclerosis, and coronary vasospasm. Multimodal cardiac imaging plays a critical role in diagnosing such pathologies by relying on noninvasive tools including echocardiograms, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, and coronary computed tomography angiography. These methods have unique considerations and in recent years have made significant progress in their diagnostic capabilities in this patient population. As the field of cardio-oncology continues to expand rapidly, guidance on the management of such toxicities and the development of imaging technologies is crucial. In this review, we present 2 complex cases of atherosclerosis and myocarditis in patients with cancer, highlighting our rationale for management and discussing the nuances of various cardiac imaging modalities.",

    "abstract": "Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is emerging as a valuable tool for noninvasive surveillance of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in patients with heart transplant (HTx). We assessed the diagnostic performance of a comprehensive CCTA-based approach compared with the invasive reference, which includes invasive coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and fractional flow reserve, for detecting CAV. This was a multicenter prospective study including 37 patients with HTx who underwent CCTA, invasive coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and fractional flow reserve. The comprehensive CCTA-based approach included quantitative and qualitative plaque analysis and functional assessment by fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography. CAV was diagnosed based on invasive coronary angiography (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria) and intravascular ultrasound. Univariable logistic regression analysis was performed to test CCTA-derived predictors of CAV. The area under the curve and accuracy indicators were calculated to evaluate the performance and best cutoffs of CCTA predictors of CAV. The median interval between CCTA and HTx was 5 years. Among the 37 recipients, 23 (62.2%) were diagnosed with CAV. The integration of diameter stenosis and plaque morphology (including plaque burden at minimum lumen area >42% and percent atheroma volume >23%) at CCTA yielded the highest diagnostic performance (accuracy, 84%; sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 86%). The integration of ∆fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography trans-vessel gradient led to increased sensitivity, albeit with decreased specificity and overall accuracy. The noninvasive approach was associated with a lower contrast and radiation dose, compared with the invasive approach. A noninvasive strategy based on CCTA is accurate for managing patients with HTx. CCTA might be considered the preferred imaging modality for annual CAV surveillance after the first year post-HTx.",

    "abstract": "A subset of patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP), a highly heritable condition, experience sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD). However, the inheritance of phenotypic imaging features of arrhythmic MVP remains unknown. We recruited 23 MVP probands, including 9 with SCA/SCD and 14 with frequent/complex ventricular ectopy. Participants underwent interviews, 2-dimensional and speckle-tracking echocardiography, and 48-hour Holter/event monitoring. Each individual was categorized as having a normal mitral valve, MVP, or borderline MVP. We assessed mitral annular disjunction, curling, global longitudinal strain, segmental peak longitudinal strain, electrical/mechanical dispersion, and the postsystolic shortening index in family members and unrelated healthy controls. We enrolled 23 pedigrees (14 extended pedigrees, 4 trios, and 5 duos) with a total of 121 participants (mean age 45 years, 50% women). Multigenerational SCA/SCD occurred in 2 of 14 extended pedigrees (14%) with an SCA/SCD proband. Mitral annular disjunction was present in 2 generations among 3 families (13%) and absent in 3 of 9 (33%) SCA/SCD cases. Compared with nonarrhythmic cases, arrhythmic MVP cases had more bileaflet involvement, mitral annular disjunction, curling, and abnormal valvular-myocardial mechanics, as expressed by a higher mid-inferior/inferolateral postsystolic shortening index (P<0.05). Among arrhythmic MVP cases, those with SCA had the highest mechanical dispersion (P=0.04). Family members with normal valves had lower global longitudinal strain and greater mechanical dispersion compared with nonpedigree controls (both P<0.05). In the context of familial MVP, SCA/SCD is rarely observed in multiple generations and is not consistently linked to mitral annular disjunction. Instead, SCA may result from combination of abnormal valvular-myocardial mechanics and a substrate of increased mechanical/electrical dispersion. Family members with normal mitral valves also exhibit mildly abnormal global strain parameters, suggesting an underlying myopathy independent of MVP expression. Future studies are needed to determine whether SCA/SCD in MVP requires the concomitant presence of abnormal mechanics and a primary genetic myopathy.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery calcium score (CACS) is widely used for risk stratification. However, in patients with established coronary artery disease, its clinical implication and relationship with plaque vulnerability are unclear. We sought to correlate the CACS and plaque vulnerability assessed by optical coherence tomography. Patients with coronary artery disease who had CACS and optical coherence tomography before percutaneous coronary intervention were included. Patients were divided into 5 groups based on CACS: CACS of 0, 1 to 99, 100 to 399, 400 to 999, and ≥1000. Optical coherence tomography-derived vulnerable features in culprit plaque were compared between the groups. In 460 patients, the prevalence of lipid-rich plaque, macrophage, and cholesterol crystal significantly differed among the 5 groups, being lowest in the patients with a CACS of 0. The prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma tended to be lower in those with a CACS of 0. No significant difference in vulnerable features was observed between the 4 groups with CACS >0. In the 2-group comparison between the group with a CACS of 0 and the other 4 groups combined, the prevalence of lipid-rich plaque (60.5% versus 85.9%; P<0.001), macrophage (48.8% versus 74.1%; P<0.001), thin-cap fibroatheroma (16.3% versus 35.0%; P=0.013), and cholesterol crystal (11.6% versus 32.9%; P=0.004) was significantly lower in the patients with CACS of 0. CACS of 0 was independently negatively associated with lipid-rich plaque, macrophage, thin-cap fibroatheroma, and cholesterol crystal after adjustment for patient characteristics. Patients with a CACS of 0 have a significantly lower prevalence of vulnerable plaque features compared with those with CACS >0 in patients with established coronary artery disease.

    "abstract": "Defining qualitative grades of echocardiographic metrics of right heart chamber size and function is critical for screening, clinical assessment, and measurement of therapeutic response in individuals with pulmonary vascular disease (PVD). In a population enriched for PVD, we sought to establish qualitative grades and prognostic value of right heart chamber size and function. We investigated 1053 study participants in the Redefining Pulmonary Hypertension through PVD Phenomics program (PVDOMICS) to determine clinical and echocardiographic differences associated with increasing pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) severity. Right heart chamber size and function were qualitatively assessed using a percentile-based approach above the median values to create a clinical grading system for right heart adaptation. The relationship between echocardiographic categories and all-cause mortality was examined using survival analyses adjusted for potential confounders. A stepwise increase in adverse right heart remodeling was observed with a concomitant decrease in functional parameters by PVR strata (p<0.001 for all). Mild, moderate, and severe categories of right heart chamber size and dysfunction were defined using a percentile-based approach across the spectrum of PVD. During a median follow up of 2.07 years (interquartile range 1.23 - 3.01 years), 130 participants died (11.4%). Progressive PVR increase and 2DE evidence of right heart dysfunction inclusive of fractional area change, and right ventricular (RV) global longitudinal strain were independently associated with increased all-cause mortality risk in multivariate analysis adjusted for age, disease duration and male sex. In this well-characterized sample of adults with diverse etiologies and varying PVD severity, we define categories of abnormal right heart chamber size and function. Further, we demonstrate a stepwise relationship between these categories of abnormal morphology and function and all-cause mortality. Defining grades of RV dysfunction in individuals with known PVD has important clinical implications for monitoring disease progression and response to therapies.",

    "title": "Use of Right Ventricular Free-Wall Strain in a Multivariable Estimate of Right Ventricular-Arterial Coupling in Pediatric Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.",
    "abstract": "Right ventricular-arterial coupling (RVAC) describes the relationship between right ventricular contractility and pulmonary vascular afterload. Noninvasive surrogates for RVAC using echocardiographic estimates of right ventricular function, such as tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), have been shown to correlate with invasively measured RVAC and predict clinical outcomes in pediatric pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, given the limitations of TAPSE at accurately estimating right ventricular function in children, we hypothesized that a multivariable estimate of RVAC using right ventricular free-wall longitudinal strain (RVFW-LS) may perform better than those utilizing TAPSE at predicting clinical outcomes. In all, 108 children from 2 institutions with pulmonary arterial hypertension underwent hemodynamic catheterization with simultaneous echocardiography. In a retrospective analysis, hybrid (echo and invasive) RVAC metrics included TAPSE/pulmonary vascular resistance (PVRi) and RVFW-LS/PVRi. Noninvasive echocardiographic metrics were TAPSE/echo-derived pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and RVFW-LS/PASP. RVFW-LS correlated with PVRi (r=0.315, P=0.01), though TAPSE did not (r=0.058, P=0.64). PVRi, PASP, and RVAC metrics declined in patients with worse World Health Organization Functional Class (n=108), while TAPSE and RVFW-LS did not. PVRi, PASP, RVFW-LS/PVRi, TAPSE/PVRi, and RVFW-LS/PASP predicted the outcome variable of transplant or death (area under the curve, 0.771 [P<0.001], 0.729 [P=0.004], 0.748 [P=0.002], 0.732 [P=0.009], and 0.714 [P=0.01], respectively), while TAPSE/PASP, RVFW-LS, and TAPSE did not (area under the curve, 0.671, 0.603, and 0.525, respectively). In patients without a history of repaired congenital heart disease (n=88), only RVFW-LS/PASP, PVRi, PASP, and RVFW-LS/PVRi predicted outcomes (area under the curve, 0.738 [P=0.002], 0.729 [P=0.01], 0.729 [P=0.01], and 0.729 [P=0.015], respectively). In the pediatric population, baseline PVRi and echo-estimated PASP were strongly associated with adverse clinical outcomes, but TAPSE and RVFW-LS were not. Estimates of RVAC utilizing RVFW-LS were superior to those utilizing TAPSE-however, only marginally additive to PASP and PVRi at predicting the adverse clinical outcome in patients without a history of repaired congenital heart disease.",

    "abstract": "Persistent immune activation is linked to elevated cardiovascular diseases in people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy. The fat attenuation index (FAI) is a measure of peri-coronary inflammation that independently predicts cardiovascular disease risk in people without HIV. Whether FAI is associated with immune activation is unknown. Peripheral blood T-cell activation and homing phenotypes were measured in people with HIV (n=58) and people without HIV (n=16) without known cardiovascular disease who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography and had FAI measurements. A cross-sectional analysis of an observational cohort was performed. The primary aim was to evaluate associations of T-cell activation and phenotypes with the outcome variables, FAI values of the right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery, which were assessed using multivariable regression models adjusted for age, natal sex, race, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, and use of lipid-lowering medication. T cells from people with HIV showed greater activation, as measured by cluster of differentiation (CD) 38/human leukocyte antigen - DR isotype coexpression on CD4 central memory and terminally-differentiated effector memory subsets and on CD8 effector memory (TEM), than did cells from people without HIV. Expression of the chemokine receptor C-C Chemokine Receptor 2 was reduced on CD4 central memory and TEM and CD8 TEM and terminally-differentiated effector memory subsets in people with HIV. Among all participants, PD-1 (programmed cell death 1) in CD8 central memory was associated with worsened peri-coronary inflammation of the right coronary artery, whereas perforin/granzyme B on CD8 TEM was associated with improved peri-coronary inflammation of the right coronary artery and left anterior descending artery in adjusted analyses. When accounting for HIV serostatus, CD38/human leukocyte antigen - DR isotype coexpression on CD8 central memory, TEM, and terminally-differentiated effector memory cells was associated with more peri-coronary inflammation of the left anterior descending artery. The associations between T-cell activation with FAI are novel and suggest that T-cell activation may be an important driver of peri-coronary inflammation, occurring at an early stage of atherosclerosis, even before the development of clinical disease.",

    "abstract": "Cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of death in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). While cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is routinely used to assess fibrosis and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, CMR measures of LV filling and ejection in DMD have not been reported. Patients with DMD (n=179) and healthy controls (n=96) were prospectively enrolled and underwent CMR. The DMD cohort was followed clinically at multiple institutions, and clinical data were recorded. Standard volumes and functions were calculated, and LV filling and ejection curves were measured from baseline CMR. Multivariable linear regressions were used to compare ventricular filling and ejection measures between groups, adjusting for baseline differences. Cox regressions were used to evaluate the relationship between diastolic function measures and mortality in the DMD cohort. Patients with DMD had significantly smaller stature and ventricular volumes than healthy control patients (P<0.001). They had lower baseline LV ejection fraction (P<0.001), though most had normal systolic function. When adjusted for age, sex, heart rate, body surface area, and LV end-diastolic volume, patients with DMD had slower peak filling rates (P<0.001) and peak ejection rates (P<0.001), as well as slower time to peak ventricular ejection rate (P=0.011). When adjusted for heart rate, a lower peak ventricular ejection rate (P=0.007) and peak filling rate (P=0.033), normalized to LV end-diastolic volume, were associated with mortality in patients with DMD. Patients with DMD have significantly different baseline CMR filling and ejection indices compared with controls. Some filling indices are associated with mortality and may be useful prognostic measures. Further research is needed in larger cohorts to determine the prognostic value of these differences.",

    "title": "Left Ventricular Hypertrophy in Aortic Stenosis: Early Cell and Matrix Regression 2 Months Post-Aortic Valve Replacement.",
    "abstract": "In aortic stenosis, the myocardium responds with left ventricular hypertrophy, which is characterized by increased left ventricular mass due to cellular hypertrophy and extracellular matrix expansion. Following aortic valve replacement (AVR), left ventricular hypertrophy regression occurs, but early cellular and extracellular dynamics are unknown. Patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing surgical or transcatheter AVR were prospectively recruited. Pre- and early post-AVR cardiac magnetic resonance imaging assessed left ventricular remodeling, global longitudinal strain, and T1 mapping to determine extracellular volume fraction and volume of cellular and extracellular compartments. In all, 39 patients (aged 71.4±9.8 years, male 79%, aortic valve peak velocity 4.4±0.5 m/s) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance before and at median 7.7 weeks post-AVR. Left ventricular mass index reduced significantly by 15.4% (P<0.001*), primarily driven by cellular compartment regression (18.7%, P<0.001*), with a smaller reduction in the extracellular compartment (7.2%, P<0.001*). This unbalanced regression led to an apparent increase in extracellular volume fraction (27.4±3.1% to 30.2±2.8%; P<0.001*). Although there was no significant change in global longitudinal strain post-AVR, an increase in extracellular volume fraction was associated with worsening of global longitudinal strain (Pearson r=0.41, P=0.01). Mode of intervention (transcatheter versus surgical) did not influence the above myocardial parameters post-AVR (all P>0.05). The asterisk in P values indicates a statistical significance of <0.05. Within 8 weeks of AVR for aortic stenosis, substantial left ventricular hypertrophy regression occurs involving both cellular and extracellular compartments, demonstrating the early myocardial adaptability to afterload relief. Cellular compartment regression is greater than extracellular regression, leading to an apparent increase in extracellular volume fraction. Mode of intervention did not affect degree of reverse remodeling, indicating that both are effective at resulting beneficial changes post-AVR.

    "abstract": "The presence and clinical significance of hepatic tissue alterations as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), are unclear. This study aimed to investigate associations of hepatic T1 patterns with myocardial tissue damage and clinical outcomes in patients suffering from STEMI. We analyzed 485 patients with STEMI treated with percutaneous coronary intervention who were enrolled in the prospective MARINA STEMI study (Magnetic Resonance Imaging In Acute ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction). Myocardial function and left and right ventricular (RV) infarct characteristics were assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance within the first week after STEMI. Native hepatic T1 times and extracellular volume were evaluated from standard cardiac T1 maps at baseline and 4 months thereafter. Median hepatic T1 times were 559 ms (interquartile range, 514-605) at baseline and decreased to 542 ms (interquartile range, 507-577) at 4 months (P<0.001). Hepatic T1 times at baseline were independently associated with female sex (β 0.116; P=0.008), hyperlipidemia (β -0.116; P=0.008), and myocardial tissue damage (infarct size: β 0.178; P<0.001; microvascular obstruction: β 0.193; P<0.001; RV infarction: β 0.161; P<0.001). Determinants of hepatic T1 times at 4 months were female sex (β 0.123; P=0.002), multivessel disease (β 0.121; P=0.002), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (β 0.101; P=0.010), RV infarction (β 0.501; P<0.001), and RV end-systolic volume index (β 0.087; P=0.031). Patients without a decrease exhibited a higher frequency of major adverse cardiovascular events (13% versus 5%; P=0.003). Hepatic T1 times at baseline (hazard ratio, 1.87 [95% CI, 1.40-2.50]; P<0.001), 4 months (hazard ratio, 2.69 [95% CI, 2.15-3.36]; P<0.001), and hepatic extracellular volume at 4 months (hazard ratio, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.33-1.90]; P<0.001) were associated with major adverse cardiovascular events. After adjustment for univariable associates, only hepatic T1 times at 4 months were independently associated with adverse outcomes (hazard ratio, 2.86 [95% CI, 1.99-4.12]; P<0.001). Hepatic tissue alterations determined by T1 mapping were associated with female sex, hyperlipidemia, multivessel disease, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and left and RV myocardial tissue damage. These alterations can persist into the chronic phase after STEMI and indicate a worse clinical outcome. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04113356.",

    "abstract": "Black adults show heightened cardiovascular risk compared with other groups despite comparable or lower coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores, indicating potential cardiovascular risk underestimation by CAC. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), preceding CAC, may predict cardiovascular events better in Black adults who are prone to early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and excess events at low CAC scores. We included 2551 participants from the JHS (Jackson Heart Study) visit 2 examination (2005-2008) without cardiovascular disease, followed through 2016. Cox regression estimated hazard ratios for incident cardiovascular events defined as a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. The predictive value of CAC and AAC, when added to the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cardiovascular risk algorithm (pool cohort equation), was assessed. Mean age was 57±10 years; 66% were women. Over a follow-up period of 12.6 years, 287 (11.3%) cardiovascular events and 360 (14.1%) mortality cases were observed. Adjusting for demographic and clinical variables, each 2-fold increase in CAC and AAC was associated with cardiovascular events (CAC: hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.06-1.13]; AAC: hazard ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.06-1.13]) and all-cause mortality CAC: hazard ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.08]; AAC: hazard ratio, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.01-1.08]). The incremental value of CAC (0.17 [95% CI, 0.08-0.23]) and AAC (0.15 [95% CI, 0.07-0.29]) to the pool cohort equation by net reclassification index was comparable. Notably, 45% of participants with 0 CAC showed some degree of AAC. Each 2-fold increase in AAC was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.01-1.19]) but not all-cause mortality among participants with 0 CAC. AAC is comparable to CAC in predicting cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality among Black adults, potentially valuable when CAC is absent.",

    "abstract": "Large vessel vasculitides (LVV) comprise a group of inflammatory disorders that involve the large arteries, such as the aorta and its primary branches. The cause of LVV is often rheumatologic and includes giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis. Giant cell arteritis is the most common form of LVV affecting people >50 years of age with a slight female predominance. Takayasu arteritis is more frequently seen in younger populations and is significantly more common in women. Prompt identification of LVV is crucial as it can lead to debilitating complications if left untreated, including blindness in the case of giant cell arteritis and large artery stenosis and aneurysms in the case of all forms of LVV. Noninvasive imaging methods have greatly changed the approach to managing LVV. Today, imaging (with ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography) is routinely used in the diagnosis of LVV. In patients with giant cell arteritis, imaging often spares the use of invasive procedures such as temporal artery biopsy. In addition, vascular imaging is also crucial for longitudinal surveillance of arterial damage. Finally, imaging is currently being studied for its role in assessing treatment response and ongoing disease activity and its potential value in determining the presence of vascular wall remodeling (eg, scarring). This review explores the current uses of noninvasive vascular imaging in LVV.",

    "abstract": "Elevated Lp(a) (lipoprotein[a]) is a risk marker for atherosclerotic disease, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We examined the association of Lp(a) with changes in coronary atherosclerosis following intensive lipid-lowering therapy. In the PACMAN-AMI trial (Effects of the PCSK9 Antibody Alirocumab on Coronary Atherosclerosis in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction), 300 patients with acute myocardial infarction were randomized to receive biweekly alirocumab 150 mg or placebo in addition to high-intensity statins. Patients underwent serial 2-vessel intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and near-infrared spectroscopy in the non-infarct-related arteries at baseline and after 52 weeks. The main end points were percent atheroma volume by intravascular ultrasound, minimum fibrous cap thickness by optical coherence tomography, and maximum lipid core burden index within 4 mm (maxLCBI4mm) by near-infrared spectroscopy. A total of 265 patients had serial intravascular ultrasound data (mean age, 58±9 years; 16% women). Alirocumab resulted in greater reductions in percent atheroma volume and maxLCBI4mm, as well as a greater increase in minimum fibrous cap thickness, compared with placebo. In the alirocumab group, the reduction in maxLCBI4mm was smaller in patients with higher baseline Lp(a), defined by the highest quartile (Q4, ≥98 nmol/L; n=30), than in those with lower baseline Lp(a) (Q1-Q3, <98 nmol/L; n=99; -40.2 [-91.1 to 10.7] versus -91.4 [-113.9 to -68.9], respectively; P=0.01 after adjustment for clinically relevant baseline variables), and was comparable to the maxLBI4mm reduction in the placebo group (-37.60 [-57.40 to -17.80]; n=134). These findings were consistent when higher baseline Lp(a) was defined by cut-off values of ≥75 versus <75 nmol/L (n=35 versus 94, respectively, in the alirocumab group) and ≥125 versus <125 nmol/L (n=23 versus 106, respectively). Changes in percent atheroma volume and minimum fibrous cap thickness did not differ in relation to baseline Lp(a). In patients with acute myocardial infarction, elevated Lp(a) at baseline is associated with attenuation of plaque lipid regression despite intensive treatment with alirocumab plus high-intensity statin. This finding may explain the residual cardiovascular risk associated with high Lp(a) despite optimal control of lipid levels. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03067844.",

    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of left ventricular filling pressure in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF) remains difficult. A novel 2-dimensional scoring system, visually assessing time difference between mitral valve and tricuspid valve opening (VMT) score, based on temporal analysis of early diastolic valve opening, could be applied to these patients. We aimed to determine the usefulness of the VMT score in patients with AF. We analyzed 119 consecutive patients with AF who underwent cardiac catheterization as a derivation cohort. The diagnostic performance of the VMT score was further evaluated in an external data set containing 189 patients with AF. Elevated left ventricular filling pressure was defined as a mean pulmonary arterial wedge pressure ≥15 mm Hg. The time sequence of atrioventricular valve opening was visually assessed and scored (0, tricuspid valve first; 1, simultaneous; 2, mitral valve first). When the inferior vena cava was dilated, 1 point was added, and the VMT score was finally graded as 0 to 3. Conventional Doppler parameters to estimate left ventricular filling pressure were also measured. Pulmonary arterial wedge pressure was elevated with an increase in the VMT score (0: 10±3, 1: 13±5, 2: 22±7, 3: 27±6 mm Hg; P<0.001), resulting in a significant rise in pulmonary arterial wedge pressure from VMT score 1 to 2. VMT≥2 predicted elevated pulmonary arterial wedge pressure with an accuracy of 87%, and the diagnostic accuracy of the VMT score was significantly higher than that of conventional Doppler parameters (C index, 0.88 versus 0.54-0.68; P<0.001). In addition, VMT ≥2 showed an incremental predictive value over plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels (C index, 0.79-0.93; P<0.001). In the external validation cohort, VMT≥2 demonstrated acceptable accuracy of 72%. VMT scoring was a useful echocardiographic marker of elevated left ventricular filling pressure and had an incremental benefit over practical biomarkers in patients with AF.",

    "title": "[99mTc]-PentixaTec SPECT/CT for Imaging of Chemokine Receptor 4 Expression After Myocardial Infarction.",
    "abstract": "Accumulation of CXCR4 (C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4)-positive immune cells after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can be visualized by positron emission tomography. For a broader clinical application, there is a need for CXCR4-directed radiotracers labeled with isotopes that can be used with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We report on the detection of CXCR4 expression after AMI in humans using the novel tracer [99mTc]-PentixaTec. In this retrospective analysis, 9 patients with AMI after mechanical revascularization underwent myocardial inflammation imaging with [99mTc]-PentixaTec SPECT/computed tomography and rest perfusion SPECT imaging. Tracer uptake in the infarcted area, spleen, bone marrow, and blood pool were used for semiquantitative analysis and calculation of signal-to-background ratios. The extent and intensity of SPECT-derived inflammatory changes were compared with serological markers and perfusion defects. CXCR4-directed SPECT was positive in all patients. Increased CXCR4 expression was only detected in areas with diminished perfusion corresponding to the affected vessel in coronary angiography, with a signal-to-background ratio (infarcted area-to-blood pool) of 2.36±0.74. Uptake in bone marrow and spleen showed a significant correlation with CXCR4 expression in the infarcted areas (r=0.73 and P=0.03 for spleen and r=0.81 and P=0.008 for bone marrow, respectively). The extent and intensity of SPECT-derived inflammatory changes showed no significant association with serum troponin, CK (creatine kinase), leukocyte, or CRP (C-reactive protein) levels. This is the first report of in vivo CXCR4 imaging after AMI using a 99mTc-labeled tracer. Increased CXCR4 expression was observed locally in the infarcted region and was related to a systemic inflammatory response in the reticuloendothelial system. This proof-of-concept investigation demonstrates the general feasibility of evaluating the inflammation-related CXCR4 expression in the myocardium after AMI using conventional scintigraphy or SPECT and might, thus, broaden its worldwide application in clinical practice.",

    "title": "Polygenic Risk Scores and Extreme Coronary Artery Calcium Phenotypes (CAC=0 and CAC≥1000) in Adults ≥75 Years Old: The ARIC Study.",
    "abstract": "Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is heterogeneous in older age and is incompletely explained by traditional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors. The extremes of subclinical atherosclerosis burden are strongly associated with either a low or high 10-year risk of incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, respectively. However, the genetic underpinnings of differences in arterial aging remain unclear. We sought to determine the independent association of 2 polygenic scores for coronary heart disease (CHD) with CAC in adults ≥75 years of age. There were 1865 ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) participants who underwent genetic testing at visit 1 (1987-1989) and CAC scans at visit 7 (2018-2019). In the primary analysis, an externally derived multi-ancestry polygenic CHD risk score was calculated for both White and Black participants. Results were confirmed using a separate ARIC-derived polygenic CHD risk score, including ≥6 million variants computed for White participants. We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess the association of polygenic CHD risk with CAC, after adjusting for baseline, time-averaged lifestyle, traditional risk factors, and local ancestry principal components. In the primary analysis, the average age was 80.6 years old, 61.6% were women, and the median CAC score was 246 (189 participants with CAC=0, 364 participants with CAC≥1000). Compared with persons below the 20th percentile of polygenic CHD risk, persons with polygenic-CHD risk above the 80th percentile had 82% lower odds of having CAC=0 (odds ratio, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.09-0.37]) and had >4-fold higher odds of CAC≥1000 (odds ratio, 4.77 [95% CI, 2.88-7.88]). On a continuous scale, each SD increment increase in the polygenic risk score was associated with a 78% higher CAC score. Results were nearly identical using a second confirmatory polygenic CHD risk score in White participants. Polygenic CHD risk is robustly associated with a lower prevalence of CAC=0 and a higher prevalence of CAC≥1000 in adults ≥75 years of age, beyond lifestyle and traditional risk factors. These results suggest a heritable contribution to distinct healthy and unhealthy arterial aging phenotypes that persist throughout the life course.",

We assessed the prognostic value of CFC derived from 82Rb positron emission tomography/computed tomography in patients with suspected coronary artery disease and normal myocardial perfusion imaging. We studied 1967 patients with suspected coronary artery disease and normal myocardial perfusion at the semiquantitative analysis of stress/rest cardiac 82Rb positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging. Coronary artery calcium scores were calculated and categorized into 3 groups: 0, 0.1 to 99.9, and ≥100. Patients were classified as having myocardial steal, severely reduced CFC, moderately reduced CFC, mildly reduced CFC, minimally reduced CFC, or normal flow using previously defined thresholds. The outcome end points were myocardial infarction and cardiac death, whichever occurred first. During a mean time of 41±27 months, 49 events occurred (2.5% cumulative event rate, with an annualized event rate of 0.5% person-years). At multivariable Cox analysis, coronary artery calcium score categories and impaired CFC resulted as independent predictors of events (both P<0.001). The annualized event rate was higher in patients with impaired CFC compared with those with normal CFC (P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with impaired CFC were at the highest risk of events. In patients with suspected coronary artery disease and normal myocardial perfusion, impaired CFC is associated with a higher risk of cardiac events. Evaluating CFC can help identify patients' candidates for additional therapies to prevent future events.",

Deep learning can provide automated quantification of coronary plaque from computed tomography angiography. We determined per-patient age- and sex-specific distributions of deep learning-based plaque measurements and further evaluated their risk prediction for myocardial infarction in external samples. In this international, multicenter study of 2803 patients, a previously validated deep learning system was used to quantify coronary plaque from computed tomography angiography. Age- and sex-specific distributions of coronary plaque volume were determined from 956 patients undergoing computed tomography angiography for stable coronary artery disease from 5 cohorts. Multicenter external samples were used to evaluate associations between coronary plaque percentiles and myocardial infarction. Quantitative deep learning plaque volumes increased with age and were higher in male patients. In the combined external sample (n=1847), patients in the ≥75th percentile of total plaque volume (unadjusted hazard ratio, 2.65 [95% CI, 1.47-4.78]; P=0.001) were at increased risk of myocardial infarction compared with patients below the 50th percentile. Similar relationships were seen for most plaque volumes and persisted in multivariable analyses adjusting for clinical characteristics, coronary artery calcium, stenosis, and plaque volume, with adjusted hazard ratios ranging from 2.38 to 2.50 for patients in the ≥75th percentile of total plaque volume. Per-patient age- and sex-specific distributions for deep learning-based coronary plaque volumes are strongly predictive of myocardial infarction, with the highest risk seen in patients with coronary plaque volumes in the ≥75th percentile.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular imaging has rapidly advanced over the past decades. Traditional imaging techniques such as echocardiography, computed tomography, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance are essential for assessing the structural and functional aspects of the cardiovascular system but often fall short in providing direct insights into disease activity. This gap is increasingly being bridged by molecular nuclear imaging techniques, including positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography, which enable the visualization of disease processes at the molecular and cellular levels. This review highlights the role of cardiovascular molecular imaging, emphasizing its current and potential applications in diagnosing and managing cardiovascular disease. With advancements in positron emission tomography scanners, novel radiotracers, and sophisticated imaging software, molecular imaging is set to play an essential role in precision medicine by enhancing our understanding of disease mechanisms, accelerating the development of targeted therapies, and facilitating personalized patient care.",

    "title": "Prognostic Value of Pulmonary Artery Systolic Pressure in Severe Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis.",
    "abstract": "Current guidelines recommend intervention for asymptomatic rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) with mitral valve area ≤1.5 cm2 based on indicators including pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) >50 mm Hg and new-onset atrial fibrillation; however, evidence supporting this is lacking. This single-center retrospective study included patients with rheumatic MS between 2006 and 2022. Pulmonary hypertension was evaluated by using echocardiography to estimate PASP. Primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and arterial thromboembolic events for up to 5 years. Overall, 287 patients with severe rheumatic MS were enrolled (mean age, 62.5±11.3 years; 74.6% women). During a median follow-up of 2.52 years, MACE occurred in 99 patients. There were no differences in echocardiographic parameters, such as the mean mitral valve pressure gradient, mitral valve area, and proportion of mitral valve area <1.0 cm2, between patients who developed primary outcomes and those who did not. Survival analysis showed a worse prognosis in patients with estimated PASP (ePASP) >50 mm Hg than in those with ePASP ≤50 mm Hg (log-rank P<0.001); however, atrial fibrillation was not a significant prognostic indicator. As a continuous variable, ePASP (mm Hg) was a significant predictor of MACE (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.027 [95% CI, 1.011-1.042]; P<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed an optimal ePASP threshold of >45 mm Hg, which was an independent predictor of MACE in patients with severe rheumatic MS (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.127 [95% CI, 1.424-3.177]; P<0.001). Competing risk analysis considering mitral valve intervention as a competing risk showed similar results. Our study demonstrated the prognostic significance of ePASP, rather than atrial fibrillation, in relation to MACE among patients with severe rheumatic MS. Additionally, we proposed a lower ePASP threshold (>45 mm Hg) as a predictor of an unfavorable prognosis.",

    "abstract": "In patients with coronary artery disease, coronary plaques with high-risk features and low-attenuation plaque burden are independent measures associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). Patients with chronic kidney failure may have different coronary artery disease characteristics. The aim was to assess the association of coronary plaque characteristics and coronary artery disease extent with MACE and all-cause mortality in patients with chronic kidney failure. Potential kidney transplant candidates who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography as part of the cardiac screening program before kidney transplantation were included. We evaluated high-risk plaques and diameter stenosis semiqualitatively and quantified coronary artery calcium score and plaque burden (percentage atheroma volume). In 484 patients with chronic kidney failure and few or no symptoms of coronary artery disease (mean age, 53±12 years; 62% men; 32% on dialysis), 56 (12%) patients suffered MACE and 69 (14%) patients died during a median follow-up of 4.9 years. High-risk plaques were present in 39 (70%) patients with MACE. Median calcified plaque burden was 3.7% in patients with MACE versus 0.2% in patients without MACE. The median low-attenuation plaque burden was 0.3% versus 0.03%, respectively. In semiqualitative analyses, the presence of high-risk plaque and a higher coronary artery calcium score were associated with increased risk of MACE (hazard ratio (HR), 2.0 [95% CI, 1.0-3.7]; P=0.040; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.3]; P=0.014), respectively. Neither were associated with all-cause mortality. In quantified analysis, increasing levels of both calcified and low-attenuation plaque burdens were associated with risk of MACE (HR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.8-3.7]; P<0.001; HR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.5-4.5]; P=0.001 [per variable doubling, respectively]) and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2-2.1]; P=0.002; HR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.1-3.0]; P=0.028, respectively). In patients with chronic kidney failure, calcified and low-attenuation plaque burdens were independently associated with MACE and all-cause mortality, while high-risk plaques and coronary artery calcium score were only associated with MACE.

    "abstract": "A recent simulation study proposed that stenosis measurements on coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography are influenced by the improved spatial resolution of photon-counting detector (PCD)-CT. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the impact of ultrahigh-spatial-resolution (UHR) on coronary stenosis measurements and Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) reclassification rates in patients undergoing coronary CT angiography on both PCD-CT and energy-integrating detector (EID)-CT and to compare measurements against quantitative coronary angiography. Patients with coronary calcification on EID-CT (collimation, 192×0.6 mm) were prospectively enrolled for a research coronary CT angiography with UHR PCD-CT (collimation, 120×0.2 mm) within 30 days (between April 1, 2023 and January 31, 2024). PCD-CT was acquired with the same or lower CT dose index and equivalent contrast media volume as EID-CT. Percentage diameter stenosis (PDS) for calcified, partially calcified, and noncalcified lesions were compared between scanners. Patient-level reclassification rates for CAD-RADS were evaluated. The accuracy of PDS measurements was validated against quantitative coronary angiography in patients who underwent invasive coronary angiography. In total, PDS of 278 plaques were quantified in 49 patients (calcified, 202; partially calcified, 51; noncalcified, 25). PCD-CT-based PDS values were lower than EID-CT measurements for calcified (45.1±20.7 versus 54.6±19.2%; P<0.001) and partially calcified plaques (44.3±19.6 versus 54.9±20.0%; P<0.001), without significant differences for noncalcified lesions (39.1±15.2 versus 39.0±16.0%; P=0.98). The reduction in stenosis degrees led to a 49.0% (24/49) reclassification rate to a lower CAD-RADS with PCD-CT. In a subset of 12 patients with 56 lesions, UHR-based PDS values showed higher agreement with quantitative coronary angiography (mean difference, 7.3%; limits of agreement, -10.7%/25.2%) than EID-CT measurements (mean difference, 17.4%; limits of agreement, -6.9%/41.7%). Compared with conventional EID-CT, UHR PCD-CT results in lower PDS values and more accurate stenosis measurements in coronary plaques with calcified components and leads to a substantial Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System reclassification rate in 49.0% of patients.",

    "abstract": "For individuals with a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of 0, CAC rescans at appropriate timings are recommended, depending on individual risk profiles. Although nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, recently redefined as metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, is a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events, its relationship with the warranty period of a CAC score of 0 has not been elucidated. A total of 1944 subjects from the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) with a baseline CAC score of 0, presence or absence of nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis, and at least 1 follow-up computed tomography scan were included. Nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis was defined using nonenhanced computed tomography and liver/spleen attenuation ratio <1. The association between nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis and new CAC incidence (CAC score >0) was evaluated using a Weibull survival model. Nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis was identified in 268 (14%) participants. Participants with nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis had higher CAC incidence than those without nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis. Nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis was independently associated with new CAC incidence after adjustment for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk factors (hazard ratio, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.05-1.57]; P=0.015). Using a 25% testing yield (25% of participants with zero CAC at baseline would be expected to have developed a CAC score >0), the warranty period of a CAC score of 0 in participants with nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis was shorter than in those without nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis (4.7 and 6.3 years). This association was consistent regardless of sex, race/ethnicity, age, and 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis had an impact on the warranty period of a CAC score of 0. The study suggests that the time period until a CAC rescan should be shorter in those with nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis and a CAC score of 0.",

    "abstract": "Intraindividual variability in lipid profiles is recognized as a potential predictor of cardiovascular events. However, the influence of early adulthood lipid profile variability along with mean lipid levels on future coronary artery calcium (CAC) incidence remains unclear. A total of 2395 participants (41.6% men; mean±SD age, 40.2±3.6 years) with initial CAC =0 from the CARDIA study (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) were included. Serial lipid measurements were obtained to calculate mean levels and variability of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and triglycerides. CAC incidence was defined as CAC >0 at follow-up. During a mean follow-up of 9.0 years, 534 individuals (22.3%) exhibited CAC incidence. Higher mean levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C were associated with a greater risk of future CAC incidence. Similarly, 1-SD increment of lipid variability, as assessed by variability independent of the mean, was associated with an increased risk of CAC incidence (LDL-C: hazard ratio, 1.139 [95% CI, 1.048-1.238]; P=0.002; non-HDL-C: hazard ratio, 1.102 [95% CI, 1.014-1.198]; P=0.022; and triglycerides: hazard ratio, 1.480 [95% CI, 1.384-1.582]; P<0.001). Combination analyses demonstrated that participants with both high lipid levels and high variability in lipid profiles (LDL-C and non-HDL-C) faced the greatest risk of CAC incidence. Specifically, elevated variability of LDL-C was associated with an additional risk of CAC incidence even in low mean levels of LDL-C (hazard ratio, 1.396 [95% CI, 1.106-1.763]; P=0.005). These findings remained robust across a series of sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Elevated variability in LDL-C and non-HDL-C during young adulthood was associated with an increased risk of CAC incidence in midlife, especially among those with high mean levels of atherogenic lipoproteins. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining consistently low levels of atherogenic lipids throughout early adulthood to reduce subclinical atherosclerosis in midlife.

    "abstract": "Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a standard technique for diagnosing myocardial infarction (MI), which, however, poses risks due to gadolinium contrast usage. Techniques enabling MI assessment based on contrast-free CMR are desirable to overcome the limitations associated with contrast enhancement. We introduce a novel deep generative learning method, termed cine-generated enhancement (CGE), which transforms standard contrast-free cine CMR into LGE-equivalent images for MI assessment. CGE features with multislice spatiotemporal feature extractor, enhancement contrast modulation, and sophisticated loss function. Data from 430 patients with acute MI from 3 centers were collected. After image quality control, 1525 pairs (289 patients) of center I were used for training, and 293 slices (52 patients) of the same center were reserved for internal testing. The 40 patients (401 slices) of the other 2 centers were used for external testing. The CGE robustness was further tested in 20 normal subjects in a public cine CMR data set. CGE images were compared with LGE for image quality assessment and MI quantification regarding scar size and transmurality. The CGE method produced images of superior quality to LGE in both internal and external data sets. There was a significant (P<0.001) correlation between CGE and LGE measurements of scar size (Pearson correlation, 0.79/0.80; intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.79/0.77) and transmurality (Pearson correlation, 0.76/0.64; intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.76/0.63) in internal/external data set. Considering all data sets, CGE demonstrated high sensitivity (91.27%) and specificity (95.83%) in detecting scars. Realistic enhancement images were obtained for the normal subjects in the public data set without false positive subjects. CGE achieved superior image quality to LGE and accurate scar delineation in patients with acute MI of both internal and external data sets. CGE can significantly simplify the CMR examination, reducing scan times and risks associated with gadolinium-based contrasts, which are crucial for acute patients.",

    "abstract": "The value of physiological ischemia versus anatomic severity of disease for prognosis and management of patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) is widely debated. A total of 1764 patients who had rest-stress cadmium-zinc-telluride single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging and angiography (invasive or computed tomography) were prospectively enrolled and followed for cardiac death/nonfatal myocardial infarction. The CAD prognostic index (CADPI) was used to quantify the extent and severity of angiographic disease. Prognostic value was assessed using Cox models, adjusted for pretest risk, known CAD, stressor, left ventricular ejection fraction, %ischemia and infarct, CADPI, and early (90-day) revascularization. Incremental prognostic value was evaluated using net reclassification index. The mean age was 69.7±9.5 years, 24.4% were women, and 29.3% had known CAD. Significant ischemia (>10%) was present in 28.4%. Nonobstructive, single, and multivessel disease was present in 256 (14.5%), 772 (43.8%), and 736 (41.7%), respectively. Early revascularization occurred in 579 (32.8%). Cardiac death/myocardial infarction occurred in 148 (8.4%) over a 4.6-year median follow-up. Both %ischemia and CADPI provided independent and incremental prognostic value over pretest clinical risk (P<0.001). In a model containing both ischemia and anatomy, ischemia was prognostic (hazard ratio per 5% ↑, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.11-1.63]; P=0.002) but CADPI was not (hazard ratio per 10-unit ↑, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.99-1.20]; P=0.07). Early revascularization modified the risk associated with %ischemia (interaction P=0.003) but not with CADPI (interaction P=0.6). %Ischemia and single-photon emission computed tomography variables added incremental prognostic value over clinical risk and CADPI (net reclassification index, 20.3% [95% CI, 9%-32%]; P<0.05); however, CADPI was not incrementally prognostic beyond pretest risk, %ischemia, and single-photon emission computed tomography variables (net reclassification index, 3.1% [95% CI, -5% to 15%]; P=0.21). Ischemic burden provides independent and incremental prognostic value beyond CAD anatomy and identifies patients who benefit from early revascularization. The anatomic extent of disease has independent prognostic value over clinical risk factors but offers limited incremental benefit for prognosis and guiding revascularization beyond physiological severity (ischemia).",

    "abstract": "In severely symptomatic patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, VALOR-HCM (A Study to Evaluate Mavacamten in Adults With Symptomatic Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Who Are Eligible for Septal Reduction Therapy) demonstrated that mavacamten reduces the need for septal reduction therapy with sustained improvement in left ventricular (LV) outflow tract gradients and symptoms. Global longitudinal strain (GLS), a measure of regional myocardial function, is a more sensitive marker of systolic function. In VALOR-HCM, we assessed serial changes in LV and right ventricular (RV) strain. VALOR-HCM included 112 patients with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (mean, 60 years; 51% male; LV ejection fraction, 68%). Patients assigned to mavacamten at baseline continued the drug for 56 weeks (n=56) and those assigned to placebo (n=52) transitioned to mavacamten from weeks 16 to 56 (40-week exposure). LV-GLS and RV-GLS assessment was performed using a vendor-neutral software. Non-foreshortened apical (4-, 3-, and 2-chamber) views were used to obtain peak LV-GLS. RV focused 4-chamber view was used to calculate RV 4-chamber and free wall strain. A more negative strain value is favorable. At baseline, the mean LV-GLS, RV 4-chamber, and free wall strain values were -14.7%, -22.2%, and -16.8%, respectively (all worse than reported normal means). In the total study sample, LV-GLS significantly improved from baseline to week 56 (P=0.02). Twelve patients had transient reduction in LV ejection fraction (<50%) requiring temporary drug interruption (including 3 permanent discontinuations). The LV-GLS in this subgroup was worse at baseline versus total study population (-11.4%), with no significant worsening from baseline through week 56 (P=0.64). Both free wall and 4-chamber RV-GLS remained unchanged from baseline to week 56 (P=0.62 and P=0.56, respectively). In VALOR-HCM, treatment with mavacamten improved LV-GLS from baseline through week 56 (with no significant worsening of LV-GLS in patients with a reduction in LV ejection fraction ≤50%), suggesting a favorable long-term impact on regional LV systolic function. Additionally, there was no detrimental impact on RV systolic function. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT04349072.",

    "abstract": "Coronary computed tomography angiography provides valuable information for evaluating the difficulty of chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention. This study aimed to investigate the value of CTO plaque characteristics derived from radiomics analysis for predicting the difficulty of percutaneous coronary intervention. Patients with CTO were retrospectively enrolled from a hospital as training and internal test sets and from the other 2 territory hospitals as external test sets. Radiomics characteristics were extracted from the CTO segment on coronary computed tomography angiography. Radiomics and combined models were developed to predict successful guidewire crossing within 30 minutes (guidewire success) of CTO percutaneous coronary intervention. Subgroup analysis was conducted to investigate the influence of potential risk factors on the radiomics model performance. A total of 551 patients (median, 60; interquartile range, 52.00-66.00 years, 460 men) with 565 CTO lesions were finally enrolled. In the training, internal test, and external test sets, 203 of 357, 85 of 149, and 38 of 59 CTO lesions achieved guidewire success, respectively. Six radiomics features were selected for constructing the radiomics model. In the external test set, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the radiomics model was significantly higher than prior prediction models (P<0.05 for all) with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.86, 74.58%, 81.58%, and 61.90%, respectively. The performance of the radiomics model was dependent on calcification, CTO location, adjacent branch(es), and operator caseload. CTO characteristics revealed by radiomics analysis can be used as effective imaging biomarkers for predicting guidewire success. However, the performance of the radiomics model depends on anatomic and operator factors.",

    "abstract": "Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is known to impact prognosis, but its determinants in coronary artery disease are poorly understood. Stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) has been used to assess ischemia and infarction in relation to the left ventricle (LV); the impact of myocardial tissue properties on RV function is unknown. Vasodilator stress CMR was performed in patients with known coronary artery disease at 7 sites between May 2005 and October 2018. Myocardial infarction was identified on late gadolinium enhancement-CMR, and infarct transmurality was graded on a per-segment basis. Ischemia was assessed on stress CMR based on first-pass perfusion and localized by using segment partitions corresponding to cine and late gadolinium enhancement analyses. RV function was evaluated by CMR-feature tracking for primary analysis with a global longitudinal strain threshold of 20% used to define impaired RV strain (RVIS); secondary functional analysis via RV ejection fraction was also performed. A total of 2604 patients were studied, among whom RVIS was present in 461 patients (18%). The presence and magnitude of RVIS were strongly associated with LV dysfunction, irrespective of whether measured by LV ejection fraction or wall motion score (P<0.001 for all). Regarding tissue substrate, regions of ischemic and dysfunctional myocardium (ie, hibernating myocardium) and infarct size were each independently associated with RVIS (both P<0.001). During follow-up (median, 4.62 [interquartile range, 2.15-7.67] years), 555 deaths (21%) occurred. Kaplan-Meier analysis for patients stratified by presence and magnitude of RV dysfunction by global longitudinal strain and RV ejection fraction each demonstrated strong prognostic utility for all-cause mortality (P<0.001). RVIS conferred increased mortality risk (hazard ratio, 1.35 [95% CI, 1.11-1.66]; P=0.003) even after controlling for LV function, infarction, and ischemia. RVIS in patients with known coronary artery disease is associated with potentially reversible LV processes, including LV functional impairment due to ischemic and predominantly viable myocardium, which confers increased mortality risk independent of LV function and tissue substrate.",

    "abstract": "Beyond therapeutic implications, PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9) has emerged as a promising cardiovascular biomarker. The exact role of PCSK9 in the setting of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is incompletely understood. We aimed to investigate the association of PCSK9 with ischemia-reperfusion injury, visualized by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, in patients with STEMI revascularized by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In this prespecified substudy from the prospective MARINA-STEMI (NCT04113356) registry, we included 205 patients with STEMI. PCSK9 concentrations were measured from venous blood samples by an immunoassay 24 and 48 hours after PCI. The primary end point was defined as presence of intramyocardial hemorrhage according to cardiac magnetic resonance T2* mapping. Secondary imaging end points were the presence of microvascular obstruction (MVO) and infarct size. The clinical end point was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events. We observed a significant increase in PCSK9 levels from 24 to 48 hours (268-304 ng/mL; P<0.001) after PCI. PCSK9 24 hours after PCI did not show any relation to intramyocardial hemorrhage, MVO, and infarct size (all P>0.05). PCSK9 concentrations 48 hours post-STEMI were higher in patients with intramyocardial hemorrhage (333 versus 287 ng/mL; P=0.004), MVO (320 versus 292 ng/mL; P=0.020), and large infarct size (323 versus 296 ng/mL; P=0.013). Furthermore, patients with increased PCSK9 levels >361 ng/mL at 48 hours were more likely to experience major adverse cardiac events (15% versus 8%; P=0.002) during a median follow-up of 12 months. In patients with STEMI, a significant increase in PCSK9 was observed from 24 to 48 hours after PCI. While PCSK9 levels after 24 hours were not related to myocardial or microvascular injury, PCSK9 after 48 hours was significantly associated with intramyocardial hemorrhage, MVO, and infarct size as well as worse subsequent clinical outcomes.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that coronary plaque burden carries greater prognostic value in predicting adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease outcomes than myocardial ischemia, thereby challenging the existing paradigm. Advances in plaque quantification through both noncontrast and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) methods have led to earlier and more cost-effective detection of coronary disease compared with traditional stress testing. The 2 principal techniques of noninvasive coronary plaque quantification assessment are coronary artery calcium scoring by noncontrast CT and coronary CT angiography, both of which correlate with disease burden on invasive angiography. Plaque quantification from these imaging modalities has shown utility in risk stratification and prognostication of adverse cardiovascular events, leading to increased incorporation into clinical practice guidelines and preventive care pathways. Furthermore, due to their expanding clinical value, emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence are being integrated into plaque quantification platforms, placing more advanced measures of plaque burden at the forefront of coronary plaque evaluation. In this review, we summarize recent clinical data on coronary artery calcium scoring and coronary CT angiography plaque quantification in the evaluation of adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients with and without chest pain, highlight how these methods compare to invasive quantification approaches, and directly compare the performance characteristics of coronary artery calcium scoring and coronary CT angiography.",

    "title": "Impaired Left Atrial Reserve Function in Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.",
    "abstract": "Left atrial (LA) dysfunction is common in heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction. However, data on the pathophysiologic impacts of impaired LA functional reserve remained limited. We sought to determine the association of abnormal LA dynamics during exercise with cardiovascular reserve, exercise capacity, and clinical outcomes. Patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (n=231) and controls without HF (n=219) underwent exercise stress echocardiography with simultaneous expired gas analysis. LA function was assessed at rest and during exercise using speckle-tracking echocardiography. Patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction demonstrated less increase in LA reservoir and booster pump strain during exercise than those in controls. The degree of LA dilation was more closely related to exercise LA reservoir strain than to resting LA strain (Meng test, P=0.002). The presence of impaired LA reservoir strain during exercise was associated with poorer biventricular systolic reserve and cardiac output augmentation, more severe right ventricular-pulmonary artery uncoupling, and lower peak oxygen consumption. Patients with a lower exercise LA reservoir strain had a 2.7-fold increased risk of HF events (hazard ratio, 2.66 [95% CI, 1.32-5.38]; P=0.006). Among patients with follow-up echocardiography, initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy or atrial fibrillation ablation showed significant improvements in LA reservoir (P<0.001 and P=0.022) and booster pump strain (P=0.011 and 0.028) at rest and during exercise, respectively. Impaired LA reservoir function during exercise in HF with preserved ejection fraction is associated with biventricular reserve limitations, exercise intolerance, and increased risks of HF events.",

    "abstract": "Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy occurs in both aortic stenosis (AS) and systemic hypertension (HTN) in response to wall stress. However, differentiation of hypertrophy due to these 2 etiologies is lacking. The aim was to study the 3-dimensional geometric remodeling pattern in severe AS pre- and postsurgical aortic valve replacement and to compare with HTN and healthy controls. Ninety-one subjects (36 severe AS, 19 HTN, and 36 healthy controls) underwent cine cardiac magnetic resonance. Cardiac magnetic resonance was repeated 8 months post-aortic valve replacement (n=18). Principal component analysis was performed on the 3-dimensional meshes reconstructed from 109 cardiac magnetic resonance scans of 91 subjects at end-diastole. Principal component analysis modes were compared across experimental groups together with conventional metrics of shape, strain, and scar. A unique AS signature was identified by wall thickness linked to a LV left-right axis shift and a decrease in short-axis eccentricity. HTN was uniquely linked to increased septal thickness. Combining these 3 features had good discriminative ability between AS and HTN (area under the curve, 0.792). The LV left-right axis shift was not reversible post-aortic valve replacement, did not associate with strain, age, or sex, and was predictive of postoperative LV mass regression (R2=0.339, P=0.014). Unique remodeling signatures might differentiate the etiology of LV hypertrophy. Preliminary findings suggest that LV axis shift is characteristic in AS, is not reversible post-aortic valve replacement, predicts mass regression, and may be interpreted to be an adaptive mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with positron emission tomography (PET) is the standard for detecting myocardial inflammation in cardiac sarcoidosis, requiring preparation with the ketogenic diet (KD) to achieve myocardial glucose suppression. Despite this, incomplete myocardial glucose suppression remains a significant issue, and strategies to reduce myocardial glucose uptake (MGU) and identify incomplete myocardial glucose suppression are required. This study sought to understand the relationship between point-of-care beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and different patterns of MGU and between KD and fasting duration with MGU in patients undergoing evaluation for cardiac sarcoidosis. We prospectively included 471 outpatients who underwent FDG-PET for cardiac sarcoidosis evaluation, followed the KD for 1 (n=100), 2 (n=29), and ≥3 days (n=342), fasted for at least 12 hours, and had BHB levels measured immediately before FDG injection. Images were classified as (1) no MGU (negative), (2) focal/multifocal (positive), (3) diffuse (nondiagnostic), or (4) nonspecific uptake (NS-MGU). Cardiac FDG-PET scans were interpreted as the following: 376 (79.83%) negative; 61 (12.95%) positive; 14 (2.97%) diffuse; and 20 (4.25%) NS-MGU. There was a strong negative relationship between BHB levels and MGU (P<0.0001). BHB levels increased significantly with KD duration (P<0.0001) and fasting time (P=0.0067). The combined rate of diffuse, NS-MGU, and positive scans (34%, 28%, 16%) decreased inversely with KD duration (1, 2, and ≥3 days, respectively). However, MGU was not different across different fasting times (P=0.6). Blood glucose levels were not associated with MGU (P=0.17) and only weakly associated with BHB levels (R2=0.03; P<0.001). We observed a strong inverse relationship between ketosis and patterns of MGU. Longer KD and fasting durations are associated with higher ketosis. However, only KD duration was associated with lower rates of MGU. Measurement of BHB levels before FDG-PET using point-of-care testing is feasible and may facilitate the management of patients referred for myocardial inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative myocardial blood flow (MBF) on positron-emission tomography myocardial perfusion imaging is a measure of the overall health of the coronary circulation. The ability to adequately augment blood flow, measured by myocardial blood flow reserve (MBFR), is associated with lower major adverse cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. The age-specific ranges of MBFR in patients without demonstrable coronary artery disease have not been well established. We aimed to determine the effect of age and sex on MBF in a cohort of patients without demonstrable coronary artery disease. Patients who underwent positron-emission tomography myocardial perfusion imaging studies from 2012 to 2022 on positron-emission tomography/computed tomography cameras were included if the summed stress score was 0, the coronary calcium score was 0, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was ≥50%. Those with known coronary artery disease, prior history of coronary intervention, diabetes, heart/kidney/liver transplant, cirrhosis, or chronic kidney disease stage IV+ were excluded. MBF was calculated using a net retention model (ImagenQ, Cardiovascular Imaging Technologies, Kansas City), and quantile regression models were developed to predict MBF. Among 2789 patients (age 59.9±13.0 years, 76.4% females), median rest MBF was 0.73 (0.60-0.91) mL/min·g, stress MBF was 1.72 (1.41-2.10) mL/min·g, and MBFR was 2.31 (1.96-2.74). Across all ages, males augmented MBF in response to vasodilator stress to a greater degree than females but achieved lower absolute stress MBF. Younger males in particular achieved a higher MBFR than their female counterparts, and this gap narrowed with increasing age. Predicted MBFR for a 20-year-old male was 3.18 and female was 2.50, while predicted MBFR for an 80-year-old male was 2.17 and female was 2.02. In patients without demonstrable coronary artery disease, MBFR is higher in younger males than younger females and decreases with age in both sexes. Age- and sex-specific MBFR may be important in risk prediction and guidance for revascularization and warrant further study.",

    "abstract": "We assessed whether combinations of cardiometabolic risk factors independently predict coronary plaque progression (PP) and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Patients with known or suspected stable coronary artery disease (60.9±9.3 years, 55.4% male) undergoing serial coronary computed tomography angiographies (≥2 years apart), with clinical characterization and follow-up (N=1200), were analyzed from the PARADIGM study (Progression of Atherosclerotic Plaque Determined by Computed Tomographic Angiography Imaging). Plaque volumes measured in coronary segments (≥2 mm in diameter) were summed to provide whole heart plaque volume (mm3) and percent atheroma volume (plaque volume/vessel volume×100; %) per patient at baseline and follow-up. Rapid PP was defined as a percent atheroma volume increase of ≥1.0%/y. Major adverse cardiovascular events included nonfatal myocardial infarction, death, and unplanned coronary revascularization. In an interscan period of 3.2 years (interquartile range, 1.9), rapid PP occurred in 341 patients (28%). At multivariable analysis, the combination of cardiometabolic risk factors defined as metabolic syndrome predicted rapid PP (odds ratio, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.12-2.03]; P=0.007) together with older age, smoking habits, and baseline percent atheroma volume. Among single cardiometabolic variables, high fasting plasma glucose (diabetes or fasting plasma glucose >100 mg/dL) and low HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females) were independently associated with rapid PP, in particular when combined (odds ratio, 2.37 [95% CI, 1.56-3.61]; P<0.001). In a follow-up of 8.23 years (interquartile range, 5.92-9.53), major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 201 patients (17%). At multivariable Cox analysis, the combination of high fasting plasma glucose with high systemic blood pressure (treated hypertension or systemic blood pressure >130/85 mm Hg) was an independent predictor of events (hazard ratio, 1.79 [95% CI, 1.10-2.90]; P=0.018) together with family history, baseline percent atheroma volume, and rapid PP. In patients with stable coronary artery disease, the combination of hyperglycemia with low HDL-C is associated with rapid PP independently of other risk factors, baseline plaque burden, and treatment. The combination of hyperglycemia with high systemic blood pressure independently predicts the worse outcome beyond PP. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02803411.",

    "abstract": "Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) are independently associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events. However, the mechanisms driving this association are poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the association between Lp(a) and coronary plaque characteristics in a contemporary US cohort without clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, undergoing coronary computed tomography angiography, the noninvasive gold standard for the assessment of coronary atherosclerosis. We used baseline data from the Miami Heart Study-a community-based, prospective cohort study-which included asymptomatic adults aged 40 to 65 years evaluated using coronary computed tomography angiography. Those taking any lipid-lowering therapies were excluded. Elevated Lp(a) was defined as ≥125 nmol/L. Outcomes included any plaque, coronary artery calcium score >0, maximal stenosis ≥50%, presence of any high-risk plaque feature (positive remodeling, spotty calcification, low-attenuation plaque, napkin ring), and the presence of ≥2 high-risk plaque features. Among 1795 participants (median age, 52 years; 54.3% women; 49.6% Hispanic), 291 (16.2%) had Lp(a) ≥125 nmol/L. In unadjusted analyses, individuals with Lp(a) ≥125 nmol/L had a higher prevalence of all outcomes compared with Lp(a) <125 nmol/L, although differences were only statistically significant for the presence of any coronary plaque and ≥2 high-risk features. In multivariable models, elevated Lp(a) was independently associated with the presence of any coronary plaque (odds ratio, 1.40, [95% CI, 1.05-1.86]) and with ≥2 high-risk features (odds ratio, 3.94, [95% CI, 1.82-8.52]), although only 35 participants had this finding. Among participants with a coronary artery calcium score of 0 (n=1200), those with Lp(a) ≥125 nmol/L had a significantly higher percentage of any plaque compared with those with Lp(a) <125 nmol/L (24.2% versus 14.2%; P<0.001). In this contemporary analysis, elevated Lp(a) was independently associated with the presence of coronary plaque. Larger studies are needed to confirm the strong association observed with the presence of multiple high-risk coronary plaque features.",

    "title": "How to Use Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Myocardial Infarction With Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries.",
    "abstract": "The working diagnosis Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA) is being increasingly recognized with the common use of high-sensitivity troponins and coronary angiography, accounting for 5% to 10% of all acute myocardial infarction presentations. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is pivotal in patients presenting with suspected MINOCA, mainly to delineate those with a nonischemic cause, for example, myocarditis and Takotsubo syndrome, from those with true ischemic myocardial infarction, that is, MINOCA. The optimal timing for CMR imaging in patients with suspected MINOCA has been uncertain and, until recently, not been examined prospectively. Previous retrospective studies have indicated that the diagnostic yield decreases with time from the acute event. The SMINC studies (Stockholm Myocardial Infarction with Normal Coronaries) show that CMR should be performed early in all patients with the working diagnosis of MINOCA, with the possible exception of patients who are clearly identified as having Takotsubo syndrome as determined by echocardiography. In addition to CMR imaging, other investigations of importance in selected patients may be pulmonary artery computed tomography to exclude pulmonary embolism, optical coherence tomography to identify plaque disruption, and acetylcholine provocation to identify coronary artery spasm. Imaging of patients with the working diagnosis MINOCA, which is centered on CMR together with supplemental investigations, results in a clear diagnosis in approximately three-quarters of the patients. This is a good example of personalized medicine, because a correct diagnosis will not only increase the satisfaction of the individual patient but also result in optimizing treatment without harming the patient.",

    "title": "Left Atrial Roof Enlargement Is a Distinct Feature of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction.",
    "abstract": "It remains unknown to what extent intrinsic atrial cardiomyopathy or left ventricular diastolic dysfunction drive atrial remodeling and functional failure in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Computational 3-dimensional (3D) models fitted to cardiovascular magnetic resonance allow state-of-the-art anatomic and functional assessment, and we hypothesized to identify a phenotype linked to HFpEF. Patients with exertional dyspnea and diastolic dysfunction on echocardiography (E/e', >8) were prospectively recruited and classified as HFpEF or noncardiac dyspnea based on right heart catheterization. All patients underwent rest and exercise-stress right heart catheterization and cardiovascular magnetic resonance. Computational 3D anatomic left atrial (LA) models were generated based on short-axis cine sequences. A fully automated pipeline was developed to segment cardiovascular magnetic resonance images and build 3D statistical models of LA shape and find the 3D patterns discriminant between HFpEF and noncardiac dyspnea. In addition, atrial morphology and function were quantified by conventional volumetric analyses and deformation imaging. A clinical follow-up was conducted after 24 months for the evaluation of cardiovascular hospitalization. Beyond atrial size, the 3D LA models revealed roof dilation as the main feature found in masked HFpEF (diagnosed during exercise-stress only) preceding a pattern shift to overall atrial size in overt HFpEF (diagnosed at rest). Characteristics of the 3D model were integrated into the LA HFpEF shape score, a biomarker to characterize the gradual remodeling between noncardiac dyspnea and HFpEF. The LA HFpEF shape score was able to discriminate HFpEF (n=34) to noncardiac dyspnea (n=34; area under the curve, 0.81) and was associated with a risk for atrial fibrillation occurrence (hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01-1.04]; P=0.003), as well as cardiovascular hospitalization (hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.00-1.04]; P=0.043). LA roof dilation is an early remodeling pattern in masked HFpEF advancing to overall LA enlargement in overt HFpEF. These distinct features predict the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular hospitalization. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03260621.",

However, the inherent heterogeneity of these diseases poses challenges, necessitating advanced analytical methods like radiomics and artificial intelligence. Radiomics extracts quantitative features from medical images, capturing intricate patterns and subtle variations that may elude visual inspection. Artificial intelligence techniques, including deep learning, can analyze these features to generate knowledge, define novel imaging biomarkers, and support diagnostic decision-making and outcome prediction. Radiomics and artificial intelligence thus hold promise for significantly enhancing diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in cardiac imaging, paving the way for more personalized and effective patient care. This review explores the synergies between radiomics and artificial intelligence in cardiac imaging, following the radiomics workflow and introducing concepts from both domains. Potential clinical applications, challenges, and limitations are discussed, along with solutions to overcome them.",

    "abstract": "Aortic valve calcification (AVC), Lp(a) [lipoprotein(a)], and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with severe aortic stenosis (AS). We aimed to determine which of these risk factors were most strongly associated with the risk of incident severe AS. A total of 6792 participants from the MESA study (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) had computed tomography-quantified AVC, Lp(a), and LDL-C values at MESA visit 1 (2000-2002). We calculated the absolute event rate of incident adjudicated severe AS per 1000 person-years and performed multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression. The mean age was 62 years old, and 47% were women. Over a median 16.7-year follow-up, the rate of incident severe AS increased exponentially with higher AVC, regardless of Lp(a) or LDL-C values. Participants with AVC=0 had a very low rate of severe AS even with elevated Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL (<0.1/1000 person-years) or LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL (0.1/1000 person-years). AVC >0 was strongly associated with severe AS when Lp(a) <50 mg/dL hazard ratio (HR) of 33.8 (95% CI, 16.4-70.0) or ≥50 mg/dL HR of 61.5 (95% CI, 7.7-494.2) and when LDL-C <130 mg/dL HR of 31.1 (95% CI, 14.4-67.1) or ≥130 mg/dL HR of 50.2 (95% CI, 13.2-191.9). AVC better identifies people at high risk for severe AS compared with Lp(a) or LDL-C, and people with AVC=0 have a very low long-term rate of severe AS regardless of Lp(a) or LDL-C level. These results suggest AVC should be the preferred prognostic risk marker to identify patients at high risk for severe AS, which may help inform participant selection for future trials testing novel strategies to prevent severe AS.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop and validate a computed tomography angiography based machine learning model that uses plaque composition data and degree of carotid stenosis to detect symptomatic carotid plaques in patients with carotid atherosclerosis. The machine learning based model was trained using degree of stenosis and the volumes of 13 computed tomography angiography derived intracarotid plaque subcomponents (eg, lipid, intraplaque hemorrhage, calcium) to identify plaques associated with cerebrovascular events. The model was internally validated through repeated 10-fold cross-validation and tested on a dedicated testing cohort according to discrimination and calibration. This retrospective, single-center study evaluated computed tomography angiography scans of 268 patients with both symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis (163 for the derivation set and 106 for the testing set) performed between March 2013 and October 2019. The area-under-receiver-operating characteristics curve by machine learning on the testing cohort (0.89) was significantly higher than the areas under the curve of traditional logit analysis based on the degree of stenosis (0.51, P<0.001), presence of intraplaque hemorrhage (0.69, P<0.001), and plaque composition (0.78, P<0.001), respectively. Comparable performance was obtained on internal validation. The identified plaque components and associated cutoff values that were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of symptomatic status after adjustment were the ratio of intraplaque hemorrhage to lipid volume (≥50%, 38.5 [10.1-205.1]; odds ratio, 95% CI) and percentage of intraplaque hemorrhage volume (≥10%, 18.5 [5.7-69.4]; odds ratio, 95% CI). This study presented an interpretable machine learning model that accurately identifies symptomatic carotid plaques using computed tomography angiography derived plaque composition features, aiding clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent guideline recommendations, quantitative perfusion (QP) estimates of myocardial blood flow from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) have only been sparsely validated. Furthermore, the additional diagnostic value of utilizing QP in addition to the traditional visual expert interpretation of stress-perfusion CMR remains unknown. The aim was to investigate the correlation between myocardial blood flow measurements estimated by CMR, positron emission tomography, and invasive coronary thermodilution. The second aim is to investigate the diagnostic performance of CMR-QP to identify obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Prospectively enrolled symptomatic patients with >50% diameter stenosis on computed tomography angiography underwent dual-bolus CMR and positron emission tomography with rest and adenosine-stress myocardial blood flow measurements. Subsequently, an invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with fractional flow reserve and thermodilution-based coronary flow reserve was performed. Obstructive CAD was defined as both anatomically severe (>70% diameter stenosis on quantitative coronary angiography) or hemodynamically obstructive (ICA with fractional flow reserve ≤0.80). About 359 patients completed all investigations. Myocardial blood flow and reserve measurements correlated weakly between estimates from CMR-QP, positron emission tomography, and ICA-coronary flow reserve (r<0.40 for all comparisons). In the diagnosis of anatomically severe CAD, the interpretation of CMR-QP by an expert reader improved the sensitivity in comparison to visual analysis alone (82% versus 88% [P=0.03]) without compromising specificity (77% versus 74% [P=0.28]). In the diagnosis of hemodynamically obstructive CAD, the accuracy was only moderate for a visual expert read and remained unchanged when additional CMR-QP measurements were interpreted. CMR-QP correlates weakly to myocardial blood flow measurements by other modalities but improves diagnosis of anatomically severe CAD.

    "abstract": "Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSIMI) is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with coronary artery disease, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unknown. We examined the relationship between stress-induced autonomic dysfunction, measured by low heart rate variability (HRV) in response to stress, and MSIMI in patients with stable coronary artery disease. We hypothesized that stress-induced autonomic dysfunction is associated with higher odds of MSIMI. In 735 participants with stable coronary artery disease, we measured high- and low-frequency HRV in 5-minute intervals before and during a standardized laboratory-based speech stressor using Holter monitoring. HRV at rest and stress were categorized into low HRV (first quartile) versus high HRV (second to fourth quartiles); the low category was used as an indicator of autonomic dysfunction. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association of autonomic dysfunction with MSIMI. The mean age was 58 (SD, ±10) years, 35% were women, 44% were Black participants, and 16% developed MSIMI. Compared with high HRV during stress, low HRV during stress (both high and low frequencies) was associated with higher odds of MSIMI after adjusting for demographic and clinical factors (odds ratio for high-frequency HRV, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.3-3.3]; odds ratio for low-frequency HRV, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.3-3.3]). Low-frequency HRV at rest was also associated with MSIMI but with slightly reduced effect estimates. In individuals with coronary artery disease, mental stress-induced autonomic dysfunction may be a mechanism implicated in the causal pathway of MSIMI.",

    "abstract": "Prominent multi-scallop systolic leaflet displacement toward the left atrium (atrialization) is typically observed in bileaflet mitral valve prolapse (MVP) with mitral annular disjunction. We hypothesized that mitral leaflet atrialization is associated with an underlying left atrial (LA) myopathy characterized by progressive structural and functional abnormalities, irrespective of mitral regurgitation (MR) severity. We identified 334 consecutive patients with MVP, no prior atrial fibrillation, and comprehensive clinical and echocardiographic data. LA function was assessed by LA reservoir strain, LA function index, and LA emptying fraction. We also classified the stage of LA remodeling based on LA enlargement and LA reservoir strain (stage 1: no remodeling; stage 2: mild remodeling; stage 3: moderate remodeling; and stage 4: severe remodeling). The primary end point was the composite risk of sudden arrhythmic death, heart failure hospitalization, or the new onset of atrial fibrillation. Bileaflet MVP with no or mild MR had a lower LA reservoir strain (P=0.04) and LA function index (P<0.001) compared with other MVP subtypes. In multivariable linear regression adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors and MR ≥moderate, bileaflet MVP remained significantly associated with lower LA function parameters (all P<0.05). There was a significant increase in the risk of events as the LA reservoir strain and LA remodeling stage increased (P<0.001). In multivariable analysis, stage 4 of LA remodeling remained significantly associated with a higher risk of events compared with stage 1 (hazard ratio, 6.09 [95% CI, 1.69-21.9]; P=0.006). In a large MVP registry, bileaflet involvement is associated with reduced LA function regardless of MR severity, suggesting a primary atriopathy in this MVP subtype. Abnormal LA function, particularly when assessed through a multiparametric approach, is linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular events and may improve risk stratification in MVP, even in those without significant MR.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular volume fraction (ECV) is a marker for myocardial fibrosis and infiltration, can be quantified using cardiac computed tomography (ECVCT), and has prognostic utility in several diseases. This study aims to map out regional differences in ECVCT to obtain greater insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of ECV expansion and its clinical implications. Three prospective cohorts were included: patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and coexisting AS and transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis were referred for a transcatheter aortic valve replacement and had ECG-gated CT angiography and Technetium-99m-labelled 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid scintigraphy to differentiate between the 2 cohorts. Controls had CT angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance demonstrating no significant coronary artery disease or infarction. Global and regional ECVCT was analyzed, and its association with mortality was assessed for patients with AS. In 199 patients, controls (n=65; 66% male), AS (n=115), and coexisting AS and transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (n=19) had a global ECVCT of 26.1 (25.0-27.8%) versus 29.1 (27.5-31.1%) versus 37.4 (32.5-46.6%), respectively; P<0.001. Across cohorts, ECVCT was higher at the base (versus apex), the inferoseptum (versus anterolateral wall), and the subendocardium (versus subepicardium); P<0.05 for all. Among patients with AS, epicardial ECVCT, rather than any other regional value or global ECVCT, was the strongest predictor of mortality at a median of 3.9 (max 6.3) years (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.08-1.36]; P=0.002). Regional differences in ECVCT suggest a predilection for fibrosis and amyloid infiltration at the base, subendocardium, inferior wall, and septum more than the anterior and lateral myocardium. ECVCT can predict long-term mortality with the subepicardium demonstrating the strongest discriminatory power. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifiers: NCT03029026 and NCT03094143.",

    "abstract": "Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are associated with subsequent adverse cardiac remodeling and cardiovascular disease. The role of myocardial microvascular disease among individuals with HDP and left ventricular (LV) remodeling as a potential link to cardiovascular disease is unknown. We aimed to determine whether individuals with HDP history have coronary microvascular dysfunction measured by coronary flow reserve 8 to 10 years after delivery and whether microvascular dysfunction correlates with LV remodeling. Individuals with pregnancies delivered from 2008 to 2010 underwent burst-replenishment myocardial contrast echocardiography (2017-2020) to quantify myocardial perfusion at rest and during dobutamine stress. Video intensity versus time data were used to derive β, the rate of rise of video intensity, a correlate for myocardial blood flow. Coronary flow reserve was calculated as the ratio of β at peak stress to β at rest, averaged across LV myocardial regions of interest. We studied 91 individuals (aged 38±6 and 9.1±0.9 years postdelivery) and 19 with a history of HDP. Individuals with coronary microvascular dysfunction (coronary flow reserve <2.0; n=13) had a higher proportion of HDP (46.2% versus 16.7%; P=0.026) and higher prepregnancy body mass index, baseline heart rate, and hemoglobin A1c compared with those without microvascular dysfunction. The association of coronary flow reserve and HDP was attenuated after adjusting for cardiometabolic factors (P=0.133). In exploratory subgroup analyses, individuals with both LV remodeling (relative wall thickness >0.42) and HDP (n=12) had the highest proportion of microvascular dysfunction (41.7% versus +HDP-LV remodeling [n=7] 14.3%; -HDP+LV remodeling [n=26] 7.7%; P=0.0498). In this small study, HDP history is associated with coronary microvascular dysfunction 1 decade after delivery, findings that may, in part, be driven by metabolic factors including obesity and diabetes. Microvascular dysfunction may contribute to cardiovascular disease among individuals with a history of HDP.",

    "abstract": "Aortic valve calcification (AVC) indexation to the aortic annulus (AA) area measured by Doppler echocardiography (AVCdEcho) provides powerful prognostic information in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). However, the indexation by AA measured by multidetector computed tomography (AVCdCT) has never been evaluated. The aim of this study was to compare AVC, AVCdCT, and AVCdEcho with regard to hemodynamic correlations and clinical outcomes in patients with AS. Data from 889 patients, mainly White, with calcific AS who underwent Doppler echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography within the same episode of care were retrospectively analyzed. AA was measured both by Doppler echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography. AVCdCT severity thresholds were established using receiver operating characteristic curve analyses in men and women separately. The primary end point was the occurrence of all-cause mortality. Correlations between gradient/velocity and AVCd were stronger (both P≤0.005) using AVCdCT (r=0.68, P<0.001 and r=0.66, P<0.001) than AVC (r=0.61, P<0.001 and r=0.60, P<0.001) or AVCdEcho (r=0.61, P<0.001 and r=0.59, P<0.001). AVCdCT thresholds for the identification of severe AS were 334 Agatston units (AU)/cm2 for women and 467 AU/cm2 for men. On a median follow-up of 6.62 (6.19-9.69) years, AVCdCT ratio was superior to AVC ratio and AVCdEcho ratio to predict all-cause mortality in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio [HR], 1.59 [95% CI, 1.26-2.00]; P<0.001 versus HR, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.11-1.65]; P=0.003 versus HR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.11-1.46]; P<0.001; all likelihood test P≤0.004). AVCdCT ratio was superior to AVC ratio and AVCdEcho ratio to predict survival under medical treatment in multivariate analyses (HR, 1.80 [95% CI, 1.27-1.58]; P<0.001 compared with HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.13-2.10]; P=0.007; HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.03-1.57]; P=0.01; all likelihood test P<0.03). AVCdCT ratio predicts mortality in all subgroups of patients with AS. AVCdCT appears to be equivalent or superior to AVC and AVCdEcho to assess AS severity and predict all-cause mortality. Thus, it should be used to evaluate AS severity in patients with nonconclusive echocardiographic evaluations with or without low-flow status. AVCdCT thresholds of 300 AU/cm2 for women and 500 AU/cm2 for men seem to be appropriate to identify severe AS. Further studies are needed to validate these thresholds, especially in diverse populations.",

In the present study, we sought to establish standard values for 2-dimensional echocardiography parameters related to chamber size and function in older adults without cardiopulmonary or cardiometabolic conditions. In this cross-sectional study of 3032 individuals who underwent 2-dimensional echocardiography at exam 6 in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), 608 participants fulfilled our inclusion criteria of healthy aging, with normative values defined as the mean ± 1.96 standard deviation and compared across sex and race and ethnicity. Functional status measures included NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), 6-minute walk distance, and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. Prognostic performance using MESA cutoffs was compared with established guideline cutoffs using time-to-event analysis. The normative aging cohort (69.5±7.0 years, 46.2% male, 47.5% White) had lower NT-proBNP, higher 6-minute walk distance, and higher (better) Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire summary values. Women had significantly smaller chamber sizes and better biventricular systolic function. White participants had the largest chamber dimensions, whereas Chinese participants had the smallest, even after adjustment for body size. Current guidelines identified 81.6% of healthy older adults in MESA as having cardiac abnormalities. Among a large, diverse group of healthy older adults, we found significant differences in cardiac structure and function by sex and race/ethnicity, which may signal sex-specific cardiac remodeling with advancing age. It is crucial for existing guidelines to consider the observed and clinically significant differences in cardiac structure and function associated with healthy aging. Our study highlights that existing guidelines, which grade abnormalities in echocardiographic cardiac chamber size and function based on younger individuals, may not adequately address the anticipated changes associated with normal aging.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of left atrial (LA) conduit function and its contribution to left ventricular (LV) filling is challenging because it requires simultaneous measurements of both LA and LV volumes. The functional relationship between LA conduit function and the severity of diastolic dysfunction remains controversial. We studied the role of LA conduit function in maintaining LV filling in advanced diastolic dysfunction. We performed volumetric and flow analyses of LA function across the spectrum of LV diastolic dysfunction, derived from a set of consecutive patients undergoing multiphasic cardiac computed tomography scanning (n=489). From LA and LV time-volume curves, we calculated 3 volumetric components: (1) early passive emptying volume; (2) late active (booster) volume; and (3) conduit volume. Results were prospectively validated on a group of patients with severe aortic stenosis (n=110). The early passive filling progressively decreased with worsening diastolic function (P<0.001). The atrial booster contribution to stroke volume modestly increases with impaired relaxation (P=0.021) and declines with more advanced diastolic function (P<0.001), thus failing to compensate for the reduction in early filling. The conduit volume increased progressively (P<0.001), accounting for 75% of stroke volume (interquartile range, 63-81%) with a restrictive filling pattern, compensating for the reduction in both early and booster functions. Similar results were obtained in patients with severe aortic stenosis. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure increased in a near-linear fashion when the conduit contribution to stroke volume increased above 60%. Maximal conduit flow rate strongly correlated with mitral E-wave velocity (r=0.71; P<0.0001), indicating that the increase in mitral E wave in diastolic dysfunction represents the increased conduit flow. An increase in conduit volume contribution to stroke volume represents a compensatory mechanism to maintain LV filling in advanced diastolic dysfunction. The increase in conduit volume despite increasing LV diastolic pressures is accomplished by an increase in pulmonary venous pressure.",

    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) fractional flow reserve (FFR)-derived functional SYNTAX score (FSSCT-FFR) is a valuable method for guiding treatment strategy in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. Dynamic CT myocardial perfusion imaging (CT-MPI) demonstrates higher diagnostic accuracy than CT-FFR in identifying hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of CT-MPI-derived FSS (FSSCT-MPI) with reference to invasive FSS. In this retrospective study, patients with multivessel coronary artery disease who underwent dynamic CT-MPI+ coronary CT angiography and invasive coronary angiography or FFR within 4 weeks were consecutively included. Invasive (FSSinvasive) and noninvasive FSS (FSSCT-MPI and FSSCT-FFR) were calculated by an online calculator, which assigned points to lesions with hemodynamic significance (defined as FFRinvasive ≤0.80, invasive coronary angiography diameter stenosis ≥90%, CT-FFR ≤0.80, and myocardial ischemia on CT-MPI). Weighted κ value and net reclassification index were calculated to determine the consistency and incremental discriminatory power of FSSCT-MPI. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used for the comparison of FSSCT-MPI and FSSCT-FFR in detecting intermediate- to high-risk patients. A total of 119 patients (96 men; 64.6±10.6 years) with 305 obstructive lesions were included. The average FSSCT-MPI, FSSCT-FFR, and FSSinvasive were 15.58±13.03, 16.18±13.30, and 13.11±12.22, respectively. The agreement on risk classification based on the FSSCT-MPI tertiles was good (weighted κ, 0.808). With reference to FSSinvasive, FSSCT-MPI correctly reclassified 27 (22.7%) patients from the intermediate- to high SYNTAX score group to the low-score group (net reclassification index, 0.30; P<0.001). In patients with severe calcification, FSSCT-MPI had better diagnostic value than FSSCT-FFR in detecting intermediate- to high-risk patients when compared with FSSinvasive (area under the curve, 0.976 versus 0.884; P<0.001). Noninvasive FSS derived from CT-MPI is feasible and has strong concordance with FSSinvasive. It allows accurate categorization of FSS in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease, in particular with severe calcification.",

    "abstract": "Significant controversy continues to confound patient selection and referral for revascularization and mitral valve intervention in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) enables comprehensive phenotyping with gold-standard tissue characterization and volumetric/functional measures. Therefore, we sought to determine the impact of CMR-enriched phenomapping patients with ICM to identify differential outcomes following surgical revascularization and surgical mitral valve intervention (sMVi). Consecutive patients with ICM referred for CMR between 2002 and 2017 were evaluated. Latent class analysis was performed to identify phenotypes enriched by comprehensive CMR assessment. The primary end point was death, heart transplant, or left ventricular assist device implantation. A multivariable Cox survival model was developed to determine the association of phenogroups with overall survival. Subgroup analysis was performed to assess the presence of differential response to post-magnetic resonance imaging procedural interventions. A total of 787 patients were evaluated (63.0±11.2 years, 24.8% women), with 464 primary events. Subsequent surgical revascularization and sMVi occurred in 380 (48.3%) and 157 (19.9%) patients, respectively. Latent class analysis identified 3 distinct clusters of patients, which demonstrated significant differences in overall outcome (P<0.001). Latent class analysis identified differential survival benefit of revascularization in patients as well as patients who underwent revascularization with sMVi, based on phenogroup classification, with phenogroup 3 deriving the most survival benefit from revascularization and revascularization with sMVi (hazard ratio, 0.61 [0.43-0.88]; P=0.0081). CMR-enriched unsupervised phenomapping identified distinct phenogroups, which were associated with significant differential survival benefit following surgical revascularization and sMVi in patients with ICM. Phenomapping provides a novel approach for patient selection, which may enable personalized therapeutic decision-making for patients with ICM.",

    "title": "Impact of Age-Related Change in Caval Flow Ratio on Hepatic Flow Distribution in the Fontan Circulation.",
    "abstract": "The Fontan operation is a palliative technique for patients born with single ventricle heart disease. The superior vena cava (SVC), inferior vena cava (IVC), and hepatic veins are connected to the pulmonary arteries in a total cavopulmonary connection by an extracardiac conduit or a lateral tunnel connection. A balanced hepatic flow distribution (HFD) to both lungs is essential to prevent pulmonary arteriovenous malformations and cyanosis. HFD is highly dependent on the local hemodynamics. The effect of age-related changes in caval inflows on HFD was evaluated using cardiac magnetic resonance data and patient-specific computational fluid dynamics modeling. SVC and IVC flow from 414 patients with Fontan were collected to establish a relationship between SVC:IVC flow ratio and age. Computational fluid dynamics modeling was performed in 60 (30 extracardiac and 30 lateral tunnel) patient models to quantify the HFD that corresponded to patient ages of 3, 8, and 15 years, respectively. SVC:IVC flow ratio inverted at ≈8 years of age, indicating a clear shift to lower body flow predominance. Our data showed that variation of HFD in response to age-related changes in caval inflows (SVC:IVC, 2, 1, and 0.5 corresponded to ages, 3, 8, and 15+, respectively) was not significant for extracardiac but statistically significant for lateral tunnel cohorts. For all 3 caval inflow ratios, a positive correlation existed between the IVC flow distribution to both the lungs and the HFD. However, as the SVC:IVC ratio changed from 2 to 0.5 (age, 3-15+) years, the correlation's strength decreased from 0.87 to 0.64, due to potential flow perturbation as IVC flow momentum increased. Our analysis provided quantitative insights into the impact of the changing caval inflows on Fontan's long-term HFD, highlighting the importance of SVC:IVC variations over time on Fontan's long-term hemodynamics. These findings broaden our understanding of Fontan hemodynamics and patient outcomes.",

    "title": "Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Feature-Tracking Identifies Preclinical Abnormalities in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Sarcomere Gene Mutation Carriers.",
    "abstract": "Assessing myocardial strain by cardiac magnetic resonance feature tracking (FT) has been found to be useful in patients with overt hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Little is known, however, of its role in sarcomere gene mutation carriers without overt left ventricular hypertrophy (subclinical HCM). Thirty-eight subclinical HCM subjects and 42 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this multicenter case-control study. They underwent a comprehensive cardiac magnetic resonance study. Two-dimensional global radial, circumferential, and longitudinal strain of the left ventricle (LV) were evaluated by FT analysis. The subclinical HCM sample was 41 (22-51) years old and 32% were men. FT analysis revealed a reduction in global radial strain (29±7.2 versus 47.9±7.4; P<0.0001), global circumferential strain (-17.3±2.6 -versus -20.8±7.4; P<0.0001) and global longitudinal strain (-16.9±2.4 versus -20.5±2.6; P<0.0001) in subclinical HCM compared with control subjects. The significant differences persisted when considering the 23 individuals free of all the structural and functional ECG and cardiac magnetic resonance abnormalities previously described. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed that the differential diagnostic performances of FT in discriminating subclinical HCM from normal subjects were good to excellent (global radial strain with optimal cut-off value of 40.43%: AUC, 0.946 [95% CI, 0.93-1.00]; sensitivity 90.48%, specificity 94.44%; global circumferential strain with cut-off, -18.54%: AUC, 0.849 [95% CI, 0.76-0.94]; sensitivity, 88.10%; specificity, 72.22%; global longitudinal strain with cut-off, -19.06%: AUC, 0.843 [95% CI, 0.76-0.93]; sensitivity, 78.57%; specificity, 78.95%). Similar values were found for discriminating those subclinical HCM subjects without other phenotypic abnormalities from healthy volunteers (global radial strain with optimal cut-off 40.43%: AUC, 0.966 [95% CI, 0.92-1.00]; sensitivity, 90.48%; specificity, 95.45%; global circumferential strain with cut-off, -18.44%: AUC, 0.866 [95% CI, 0.76-0.96]; sensitivity, 92.86%; specificity, 77.27%; global longitudinal strain with cut-off, -17.32%: AUC, 0.838 [95% CI, 0.73-0.94]; sensitivity, 90.48%; specificity, 65.22%). Cardiac magnetic resonance FT-derived parameters are consistently lower in subclinical patients with HCM, and they could emerge as a good tool for discovering the disease during a preclinical phase.",

    "abstract": "In heart transplant recipients, right ventricular (RV) dysfunction may occur for a variety of reasons. Whether RV dysfunction in the stable phase after heart transplantation is associated with long-term adverse outcomes is unknown. We aimed to determine the long-term prognostic significance of RV dysfunction identified on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) at least 1 year after heart transplantation. In consecutive heart transplant recipients who underwent CMR for surveillance, we assessed 2 CMR measures of RV function: RV ejection fraction and RV global longitudinal strain (RVGLS). We investigated associations between RV dysfunction and a composite end point of death or major adverse cardiac events, including retransplantation, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and heart failure hospitalization. A total of 257 heart transplant recipients (median age, 59 years; 75% men) who had CMR at a median of 4.3 years after heart transplantation were included. Over a median follow-up of 4.4 years after the CMR, 108 recipients experienced death or major adverse cardiac events. In a multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, time since transplantation, indication for transplantation, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, history of rejection, and CMR covariates, RV ejection fraction was not associated with the composite end point, but RVGLS was independently associated with the composite end point with a hazard ratio of 1.08 per 1% worsening in RVGLS ([95% CI, 1.00-1.17]; P=0.046). RVGLS provided incremental prognostic value over other variables in multivariable analyses. The association was replicated in subgroups of recipients with normal RV ejection fraction and recipients with late gadolinium enhancement imaging. A similar association was seen with a composite end point of cardiovascular death or major adverse cardiac events. CMR feature tracking-derived RVGLS assessed at least 1 year after heart transplantation was independently associated with the long-term risk of death or major adverse cardiac events. Future studies should investigate its role in guiding clinical decision-making in heart transplant recipients.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative flow ratio derived from computed tomography angiography (CT-QFR) and invasive coronary angiography (Murray law-based quantitative flow ratio [μQFR]) are novel approaches enabling rapid computation of fractional flow reserve without the use of pressure guidewires and vasodilators. However, the feasibility and diagnostic performance of both CT-QFR and μQFR in evaluating complex coronary lesions remain unclear. Between September 2014 and September 2021, 240 patients with 30% to 90% coronary diameter stenosis who underwent both coronary computed tomography angiography and invasive coronary angiography with fractional flow reserve within 60 days were retrospectively enrolled. The diagnostic performance of CT-QFR and μQFR in detecting functional ischemia among all lesions, especially complex coronary lesions, was analyzed using fractional flow reserve as the reference standard. CT-QFR and μQFR analyses were performed on 309 and 289 vessels, respectively. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for CT-QFR in all lesions at the per-vessel level were 91% (with a 95% CI of 84%-96%), 92% (95% CI, 88%-95%), 83% (95% CI, 75%-90%), 96% (95% CI, 93%-98%), and 92% (95% CI, 88%-95%), with values for μQFR of 90% (95% CI, 81%-95%), 97% (95% CI, 93%-99%), 92% (95% CI, 84%-97%), 96% (95% CI, 92%-98%), and 94% (95% CI, 91%-97%), respectively. Among bifurcation, tandem, and moderate-to-severe calcified lesions, the diagnostic values of CT-QFR and μQFR showed great correlation and agreement with those of invasive fractional flow reserve, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve exceeding 0.9 for each complex lesion at the vessel level. Furthermore, the accuracies of CT-QFR and μQFR in the gray zone were 85% and 84%, respectively. Angiography-derived quantitative flow ratio (CT-QFR and μQFR) demonstrated remarkable diagnostic performance in complex coronary lesions, indicating its pivotal role in the management of patients with coronary artery disease.",

    "abstract": "Multimodality imaging is currently suggested for the noninvasive diagnosis of cardiac masses. The identification of cardiac masses' malignant nature is essential to guide proper treatment. We aimed to develop a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-derived model including mass localization, morphology, and tissue characterization to predict malignancy (with histology as gold standard), to compare its accuracy versus the diagnostic echocardiographic mass score, and to evaluate its prognostic ability. Observational cohort study of 167 consecutive patients undergoing comprehensive echocardiogram and CMR within 1-month time interval for suspected cardiac mass. A definitive diagnosis was achieved by histological examination or, in the case of cardiac thrombi, by histology or radiological resolution after adequate anticoagulation treatment. Logistic regression was performed to assess CMR-derived independent predictors of malignancy, which were included in a predictive model to derive the CMR mass score. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used to investigate the prognostic ability of predictors. In CMR, mass morphological features (non-left localization, sessile, polylobate, inhomogeneity, infiltration, and pericardial effusion) and mass tissue characterization features (first-pass perfusion and heterogeneity enhancement) were independent predictors of malignancy. The CMR mass score (range, 0-8 and cutoff, ≥5), including sessile appearance, polylobate shape, infiltration, pericardial effusion, first-pass contrast perfusion, and heterogeneity enhancement, showed excellent accuracy in predicting malignancy (areas under the curve, 0.976 [95% CI, 0.96-0.99]), significantly higher than diagnostic echocardiographic mass score (areas under the curve, 0.932; P=0.040). The agreement between the diagnostic echocardiographic mass and CMR mass scores was good (κ=0.66). A CMR mass score of ≥5 predicted a higher risk of all-cause death (P<0.001; hazard ratio, 5.70) at follow-up. A CMR-derived model, including mass morphology and tissue characterization, showed excellent accuracy, superior to echocardiography, in predicting cardiac masses malignancy, with prognostic implications.",

    "abstract": "Luminal stenosis, computed tomography-derived fractional-flow reserve (FFRCT), and high-risk plaque features on coronary computed tomography angiography are all known to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The interactions between these variables, patient outcomes, and quantitative plaque volumes have not been previously described. Patients with coronary computed tomography angiography (n=4430) and one-year outcome data from the international ADVANCE (Assessing Diagnostic Value of Noninvasive FFRCT in Coronary Care) registry underwent artificial intelligence-enabled quantitative coronary plaque analysis. Optimal cutoffs for coronary total plaque volume and each plaque subtype were derived using receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis. The resulting plaque volumes were adjusted for age, sex, hypertension, smoking status, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, luminal stenosis, distal FFRCT, and translesional delta-FFRCT. Median plaque volumes and optimal cutoffs for these adjusted variables were compared with major adverse cardiac events, late revascularization, a composite of the two, and cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction. At one year, 55 patients (1.2%) had experienced major adverse cardiac events, and 123 (2.8%) had undergone late revascularization (>90 days). Following adjustment for age, sex, risk factors, stenosis, and FFRCT, total plaque volume above the receiver-operator characteristic curve-derived optimal cutoff (total plaque volume >564 mm3) was associated with the major adverse cardiac event/late revascularization composite (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.515 [95% CI, 1.093-2.099]; P=0.0126), and both components. Total percent atheroma volume greater than the optimal cutoff was associated with both major adverse cardiac event/late revascularization (total percent atheroma volume >24.4%; hazard ratio, 2.046 [95% CI, 1.474-2.839]; P<0.0001) and cardiovascular death/myocardial infarction (total percent atheroma volume >37.17%, hazard ratio, 4.53 [95% CI, 1.943-10.576]; P=0.0005). Calcified, noncalcified, and low-attenuation percentage atheroma volumes above the optimal cutoff were associated with all adverse outcomes, although this relationship was not maintained for cardiovascular death/myocardial infarction in analyses stratified by median plaque volumes. Analysis of the ADVANCE registry using artificial intelligence-enabled quantitative plaque analysis shows that total plaque volume is associated with one-year adverse clinical events, with incremental predictive value over luminal stenosis or abnormal physiology by FFRCT.

    "abstract": "Left atrial (LA) speckle tracking provides detailed information on atrial function. Its utility for predicting subclinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF) is unclear. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether LA strain measures could predict SCAF detected by long-term continuous rhythm monitoring. This was an echocardiographic substudy of the LOOP study, where elderly at risk of stroke were randomized to receive a loop recorder (Reveal LINQ) or control. Participants who received a loop recorder were included in this analysis. Echocardiography included LA reservoir, conduit, and contraction strain. Participants were followed with continuous rhythm monitoring for SCAF (≥6 minutes). Cox proportional hazards regression was applied to adjust for atrial fibrillation risk factors. In total, 956 participants were eligible for analysis. Median continuous rhythm monitoring was 35 months (IQR, 20-40 months), during which 278 (29%) were diagnosed with SCAF. The mean age was 74 years, 56% were male, median CHA2DS2-VASc-score was 4. LA reservoir strain was an independent predictor of SCAF after multivariable adjustments (HR, 1.04 [1.02-1.05], per 1% decrease) and so was contraction strain. The findings were unchanged in competing risk analyses and in participants with normal LA size and diastolic function. Participants with low reservoir strain (<33%) had a significantly higher risk of SCAF compared with those with high reservoir strain (incidence rate, 14.5 [12.4-16.9] versus 9.8 [8.2-11.8] events/100 person-years). The same was noted for low versus high contraction strain. LA reservoir and contraction strain are independent predictors of SCAF in elderly at risk of stroke. This also applies to individuals with normal LA size and diastolic function. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02036450.",

    "abstract": "Patients with only moderate atrial secondary mitral regurgitation (asMR) frequently develop heart failure (HF). Mechanisms of HF with moderate asMR and the impact of mild asMR remain unclarified. Although mild/moderate primary mitral regurgitation is compensated by left ventricular (LV) dilatation, the LV is not dilated in asMR. We hypothesized that patients with mild asMR without LV dilatation may have impaired hemodynamics and higher risks of subsequent symptomatic HF deterioration. Stroke volume, cardiac output, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure were measured by echocardiography in 142 patients with isolated atrial fibrillation and 30 healthy controls. The prognosis of patients with isolated atrial fibrillation was followed up. In the 142 patients with isolated atrial fibrillation, asMR was no/trivial in 55, mild in 83, moderate in 4, while none had severe asMR. Compared with controls and patients with no/trivial asMR, LV end-diastolic volume index was not increased and hemodynamic parameters were abnormal in patients with mild asMR (LV end-diastolic volume index, 65±6 versus 58±8 versus 60±8 mL/m²; stroke volume index, 42±4 versus 35±4 versus 29±6 mL/m²; P<0.001 versus other 2 groups; cardiac output index, 2.8±0.4 versus 2.8±0.5 versus 2.3±0.6 L/min per m²; P<0.001; systolic pulmonary artery pressure, 21±3 versus 26±5 versus 37±9 mm Hg; P<0.001). Although the event-free rate of HF symptomatic deterioration or hospitalization in patients with no/trivial asMR during a median 13.9 months follow-up was 86.9% and 100%, the rate in mild asMR was 59.4% and 85.0% (P<0.001 or P=0.032), respectively. In the presence of isolated AF and no compensatory LV dilatation, impaired hemodynamics and higher risks of symptomatic HF deterioration were associated with mild asMR, requiring further studies of causalities.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) reference values are relied upon to accurately diagnose left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) pathologies. To date, reference values have been derived from modest sample sizes with limited patient diversity and attention to 1 but not both commonly used tracing techniques for papillary muscles and trabeculations. We sought to overcome these limitations by meta-analyzing normal reference values for CMR parameters stemming from multiple countries, vendors, analysts, and patient populations. We comprehensively extracted published and unpublished data from studies reporting CMR parameters in healthy adults. A steady-state free-precession short-axis stack at 1.5T or 3T was used to trace either counting the papillary muscles and trabeculations in the LV volume or mass. We used a novel Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis model to derive the pooled lower and upper reference values for each CMR parameter. Our model accounted for the expected differences between tracing techniques by including informative prior distributions from a large external data set. A total of 254 studies from 25 different countries were systematically reviewed, representing 12 812 healthy adults, of which 52 were meta-analyzed. For LV parameters counting papillary muscles and trabeculations in the LV volume, pooled normative reference ranges in men and women, respectively, were as follows: LV ejection fraction of 52% to 73% and 54% to 75%, LV end-diastolic volume index of 60 to 109 and 56 to 96 mL/m2, LV end-systolic volume index of 18 to 45 and 16 to 38 mL/m2, and LV mass index of 41 to 76 and 33 to 57 g/m2. For LV parameters counting papillary muscles and trabeculations in the LV mass, pooled normative reference ranges in men and women, respectively, were as follows: LV ejection fraction of 57% to 74% and 57% to 75%, LV end-diastolic volume index of 60 to 97 and 55 to 88 mL/m2, LV end-systolic volume index of 18 to 37 and 15 to 34 mL/m2, and LV mass index of 50 to 83 and 38 to 65 g/m2. For RV parameters, pooled normative reference ranges in men and women, respectively, were as follows: RV ejection fraction of 47% to 68% and 49% to 71%, RV end-diastolic volume index of 64 to 115 and 57 to 99 mL/m2, RV end-systolic volume index of 23 to 52 and 18 to 42 mL/m2, and RV mass index of 14 to 29 and 13 to 25 g/m2. Our Bayesian hierarchical meta-analysis provides normative reference values for CMR parameters of LV and RV size, systolic function, and mass, encompassing both tracing techniques across a diverse multinational sample of healthy men and women.",

    "abstract": "Coronary artery calcium computed tomography (CAC) is an important tool for identifying subclinical atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite robust evidence and inclusion in current guidelines, CAC is considered investigational by some US insurance carriers and requires out-of-pocket expenses. CAC can be obtained via self-referral (SR) or physician referral (PR). We aimed to examine differences in patient, socioeconomic, and CAC characteristics between referral groups. We evaluated demographic, medical history, and CAC results of consecutive patients with a CAC completed at one of multiple Wisconsin sites from March 1, 2019, to June 30, 2021. We separated patients into SR and PR groups. Through census data, we analyzed socioeconomic variables at the block level including race and ethnicity, median income, average household size, and high school completion in the areas where patients resided at the time of CAC. The final analysis included 19 726 patients: 13 835 (70.1%) PR and 5891 (29.9%) SR. Most patients in both groups were White (95.2% versus 95.1%), with the Black/African American population representing 2.7% (SR) and 2.3% (PR). The PR group had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. SR patients were more likely to have a score of 0 (41.2% versus 38.1%; P<0.001); PR patients had a higher prevalence of CAC >300 (16.8% versus 14.8%; P<0.001). SR patients were more likely to be women (55.1% versus 48.9%; P<0.001) and were found to live in higher income areas (19.5% versus 16.4%; P<0.001). Patients from low-income areas comprised the smallest proportion in both groups (7.5%). Patients who obtain out-of-pocket CAC live predominantly in medium- and high-income areas, and patients from lower income locations are less likely to obtain CAC despite having more cardiovascular disease risk factors. Consideration should be made from a policy perspective to promote health equity and improve utilization of CAC testing among underrepresented groups.",

These advances in noninvasive cardiac imaging have also expanded the role of the cardiac imager and dramatically increased the demand for imagers who are cross-trained in multiple modalities. However, we hypothesize that there is significant variation in the availability of cardiac imaging expertise and a disparity in the adoption of advanced imaging technologies across the United States. To evaluate this, we have brought together the leaders of cardiovascular imaging societies, imaging trainees, as well as collaborated with national imaging accreditation commissions and imaging certification boards to assess the state of cardiac imaging and the diversity of the imaging workforce in the United States. Aggregate data confirm the presence of critical gaps, such as limited access to imaging and imaging expertise in rural communities, as well as disparities in the imaging workforce, notably among women and underrepresented minorities. Based on these results, we have proposed solutions to promote and maintain a robust and diverse community of cardiac imagers and improve equity and accessibility for cardiac imaging technologies.",

    "abstract": "Bias in health care has been well documented and results in disparate and worsened outcomes for at-risk groups. Medical imaging plays a critical role in facilitating patient diagnoses but involves multiple sources of bias including factors related to access to imaging modalities, acquisition of images, and assessment (ie, interpretation) of imaging data. Machine learning (ML) applied to diagnostic imaging has demonstrated the potential to improve the quality of imaging-based diagnosis and the precision of measuring imaging-based traits. Algorithms can leverage subtle information not visible to the human eye to detect underdiagnosed conditions or derive new disease phenotypes by linking imaging features with clinical outcomes, all while mitigating cognitive bias in interpretation. Importantly, however, the application of ML to diagnostic imaging has the potential to either reduce or propagate bias. Understanding the potential gain as well as the potential risks requires an understanding of how and what ML models learn. Common risks of propagating bias can arise from unbalanced training, suboptimal architecture design or selection, and uneven application of models. Notwithstanding these risks, ML may yet be applied to improve gain from imaging across all 3A's (access, acquisition, and assessment) for all patients. In this review, we present a framework for understanding the balance of opportunities and challenges for minimizing bias in medical imaging, how ML may improve current approaches to imaging, and what specific design considerations should be made as part of efforts to maximize the quality of health care for all.",

    "abstract": "Achieving optimal cardiovascular health in rural populations can be challenging for several reasons including decreased access to care with limited availability of imaging modalities, specialist physicians, and other important health care team members. Therefore, innovative solutions are needed to optimize health care and address cardiovascular health disparities in rural areas. Mobile examination units can bring imaging technology to underserved or remote communities with limited access to health care services. Mobile examination units can be equipped with a wide array of assessment tools and multiple imaging modalities such as computed tomography scanning and echocardiography. The detailed structural assessment of cardiovascular and lung pathology, as well as the detection of extracardiac pathology afforded by computed tomography imaging combined with the functional and hemodynamic assessments acquired by echocardiography, yield deep phenotyping of heart and lung disease for populations historically underrepresented in epidemiological studies. Moreover, by bringing the mobile examination unit to local communities, innovative approaches are now possible including engagement with local professionals to perform these imaging assessments, thereby augmenting local expertise and experience. However, several challenges exist before mobile examination unit-based examinations can be effectively integrated into the rural health care setting including standardizing acquisition protocols, maintaining consistent image quality, and addressing ethical and privacy considerations. Herein, we discuss the potential importance of cardiac multimodality imaging to improve cardiovascular health in rural regions, outline the emerging experience in this field, highlight important current challenges, and offer solutions based on our experience in the RURAL (Risk Underlying Rural Areas Longitudinal) cohort study.",

This study investigated the sex-specific differences in the coronary computed tomography angiography-assessed coronary response to mental stress. This retrospective study included patients with coronary artery disease and without cancer who underwent resting 18F-fluorodexoyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography and coronary computed tomography angiography within 3 months. 18F-flourodeoxyglucose resting amygdalar uptake, an imaging biomarker of stress-related neural activity, coronary inflammation (fat attenuation index), and high-risk plaque characteristics were assessed by coronary computed tomography angiography. Their correlation and prognostic values were assessed according to sex. A total of 364 participants (27.7% women and 72.3% men) were enrolled. Among those with heightened stress-related neural activity, women were more likely to have a higher fat attenuation index (43.0% versus 24.0%; P=0.004), while men had a higher frequency of high-risk plaques (53.7% versus 39.3%; P=0.036). High amygdalar 18F-flourodeoxyglucose uptake (B-coefficient [SE], 3.62 [0.21]; P<0.001) was selected as the strongest predictor of fat attenuation index in a fully adjusted linear regression model in women, and the first-order interaction term consisting of sex and stress-related neural activity was significant (P<0.001). Those with enhanced imaging biomarkers of stress-related neural activity showed increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular event both in women (24.5% versus 5.1%; adjusted hazard ratio, 3.62 [95% CI, 1.14-17.14]; P=0.039) and men (17.2% versus 6.9%; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.72 [95% CI, 1.10-6.69]; P=0.030). Imaging-assessed stress-related neural activity carried prognostic values irrespective of sex; however, a sex-specific mechanism linking psychological stress to coronary plaque phenotypes existed in the current hypothesis-generating study.

    "abstract": "It is not known whether there is a sex difference in the association between perivascular inflammation and plaque vulnerability. The aim of this study was to investigate the sex-specific association between perivascular inflammation and plaque vulnerability. Patients who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography and optical coherence tomography were enrolled. All images were analyzed at a core laboratory. The level of perivascular inflammation was assessed by pericoronary adipose tissue attenuation on computed tomography angiography and the level of plaque vulnerability by optical coherence tomography. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to tertile levels of culprit vessel pericoronary adipose tissue attenuation (low inflammation, ≤-73.1 Hounsfield units; moderate inflammation, -73.0 to -67.0 Hounsfield units; or high inflammation, ≥-66.9 Hounsfield units). A total of 968 lesions in 409 patients were included: 184 lesions in 82 women (2.2 plaques per patient) and 784 lesions in 327 men (2.4 plaques per patient). Women were older (median age, 71 versus 65 years; P<0.001) and had less severe coronary artery disease with a lower plaque burden than men. In women, it was found that perivascular inflammation was significantly associated with plaque vulnerability, with a higher prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma and greater macrophage grades in the high inflammation group compared with the low inflammation group (low versus moderate versus high inflammation in women: 18.5% versus 31.8% versus 46.9%, P=0.002 for low versus high inflammation; 3 versus 4 versus 12, P<0.001 for low versus high inflammation, respectively). However, no significant differences were observed among the 3 groups in men. Perivascular inflammation was associated with a higher prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma and more significant macrophage accumulation in women but not in men.

    "abstract": "Advanced chronic kidney disease is associated with high cardiovascular risk, even after kidney transplant. Pretransplant cardiac testing may identify patients who require additional assessment before transplant or would benefit from risk optimization. The objective of the current study was to determine the relative prognostic utility of pretransplant positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for posttransplant major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). We retrospectively followed patients who underwent MPI before kidney transplant for the occurrence of MACE after transplant including myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and cardiac death. An abnormal MPI result was defined as a total perfusion deficit >5% of the myocardium. To determine associations of MPI results with MACE, we utilized Cox hazard regression with propensity weighting for PET versus SPECT with model factors, including demographics and cardiovascular risk factors. A total of 393 patients underwent MPI (208 PET and 185 SPECT) and were followed for a median of 5.9 years post-transplant. Most were male (58%), median age was 58 years, and there was a high burden of hypertension (88%) and diabetes (33%). A minority had abnormal MPI (n=58, 15%). In propensity-weighted hazard regression, abnormal PET result was associated with posttransplant MACE (hazard ratio, 3.02 [95% CI, 1.78-5.11]; P<0.001), while there was insufficient evidence of an association of abnormal SPECT result with MACE (1.39 [95% CI, 0.72-2.66]; P=0.33). The explained relative risk of the PET result was higher than the SPECT result (R2 0.086 versus 0.007). Normal PET was associated with the lowest risk of MACE (2.2%/year versus 3.6%/year for normal SPECT; P<0.001). Kidney transplant recipients are at high cardiovascular risk, despite a minority having obstructive coronary artery disease on MPI. PET MPI findings predict posttransplant MACE. Normal PET may better discriminate lower risk patients compared with normal SPECT, which should be confirmed in a larger prospective study.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication after cardiac surgery being associated with poorer outcomes. Revealing before the operation of left atrial subtle structural/functional abnormalities may help to identify patients at increased risk of POAF. We investigated the role of left atrial strain parameters by preoperative speckle tracking echocardiography as independent predictors of POAF in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft. Consecutive patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft were prospectively enrolled at three Italian centers. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography before the operation. The occurrence of POAF up to discharge was monitored. Overall, a total of 310 patients were included. POAF was demonstrated in 103 patients (33%). At receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, lower global peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS) values significantly predicted the risk of POAF (area under the curve, 0.74; P<0.001). The optimal cutoff value for the arrhythmia prediction was a global PALS value <28%, with a specificity of 86% and a sensitivity of 36%. The incidence of POAF was 51% in patients with global PALS <28% versus 14% in those with PALS ≥28% (P<0.001), with a POAF-free survival at Kaplan-Meier analysis of 45.4% and 85.7%, respectively (P<0.001). At multivariate analysis, a global PALS <28% carried a 3.6-fold higher risk of POAF (hazard ratio, 3.6 [95% CI, 2.2-5.9]; P<0.001). The risk increase was even higher when PALS <28% was associated with age ≥70 years (adjusted hazard ratio, 11.2 [4.7-26.6], P<0.001). A presurgery global PALS <28% is a specific parameter to stratify patients at increased risk of POAF after coronary artery bypass graft. This assessment can be useful to identify patients at higher arrhythmic risk in whom perioperative preventive strategies and stricter monitoring aimed at early diagnosing and treating POAF may be applied.",

However, the effect on diagnostic accuracy is unknown. The aim was to investigate the optimal RbPET reading algorithm for improved identification of obstructive CAD. Prospectively enrolled patients (N=400) underwent RbPET and invasive coronary angiography with fractional flow reserve and quantitative coronary angiography. Quantitative measurements (myocardial blood flow (MBF), MBF reserve, transient ischemic dilatation) by RbPET were step-wisely added to a qualitative assessment by the summed stress score based on their diagnostic accuracy of obstructive CAD by invasive coronary angiography-fractional flow reserve. Prespecified cutoffs were summed stress score ≥4, hyperemic MBF 2.00 mL/g per min, and MBF reserve 1.80, respectively. Hemodynamically obstructive CAD was defined as >90% diameter stenosis or invasive coronary angiography-fractional flow reserve ≤0.80, and sensitivity analyses included a clinically relevant reference of anatomically severe CAD (>70% diameter stenosis by invasive coronary angiography-quantitative coronary angiography). Hemodynamically obstructive CAD was present in 170/400 (42.5%) patients. Stand-alone summed stress score showed a sensitivity and specificity of 57% and 93%, respectively, while hyperemic MBF showed similar sensitivity (61%, P=0.57) but lower specificity (85%, P=0.008). With increased discrimination by receiver-operating characteristic curves (0.78 versus 0.85; P<0.001), combining summed stress score, MBF and MBF reserve showed the highest sensitivity of 77% but lower specificity of 74% (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Against anatomically severe CAD, all measures independently yielded high discrimination ≥0.90 with increased sensitivity and lower specificity by additional quantification. The inclusion of quantitative measurements to a RbPET read increases in the identification of obstructive CAD. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT03481712.",

Nevertheless, the factors underlying the effect of lipid-lowering therapy on disease regression remain poorly characterized. Our aim was to determine which characteristics of atherosclerotic plaque are associated with a greater reduction in coronary plaque burden (PB) after treatment with alirocumab in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. The ARCHITECT study (Effect of Alirocumab on Atherosclerotic Plaque Volume, Architecture and Composition) is a phase IV, open-label, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial to assess the effect of the treatment with alirocumab for 78 weeks on the coronary atherosclerotic PB and its characteristics in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia without clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Participants underwent a coronary computed tomographic angiography at baseline and a final one at 78 weeks. Every patient received alirocumab 150 mg subcutaneously every 14 days in addition to high-intensity statin therapy. One hundred and four patients were enrolled. Median age was 53.3 (46.2-59.4) years and 54 were women (51.9%). The global coronary PB changed from 34.6% (32.5%-36.8%) at entry to 30.4% (27.4%-33.4%) at follow-up, which is -4.6% (-7.7% to -1.9%; P<0.001) reduction. A decrease in the percentage of unstable core (fibro-fatty+necrotic plaque; from 14.1 [7.9-22.3] to 8.0 [6.4-10.6]; -6.6%; P<0.001) was found. A greater PB (β, 0.36 [0.13-0.59]; P=0.002) and a higher proportion of unstable core (β, 0.15 [0.08-0.22]; P<0.001) were significantly related to PB regression. Treatment with alirocumab in addition to high-intensity statin therapy might produce a greater PB regression in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia with higher baseline PB and in those with larger unstable core. Further studies are needed to corroborate the hypothesis raised by these results. URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT05465278.",

    "title": "Higher Noncalcified Plaque Volume Is Associated With Increased Plaque Vulnerability and Vascular Inflammation.",
    "abstract": "Recently, it was reported that noncalcified plaque (NCP) volume was an independent predictor for cardiac events. Pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) attenuation is a marker of vascular inflammation and has been associated with increased cardiac mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationships between NCP volume, plaque vulnerability, and PCAT attenuation. Patients who underwent preintervention coronary computed tomography angiography and optical coherence tomography were enrolled. Plaque volume was measured by computed tomography angiography, plaque vulnerability by optical coherence tomography, and the level of coronary inflammation by PCAT attenuation. The plaques were divided into 2 groups of high or low NCP volume based on the median NCP volume. Among 704 plaques in 454 patients, the group with high NCP volume had a higher prevalence of lipid-rich plaque (87.2% versus 75.9%; P<0.001), thin-cap fibroatheroma (38.1% versus 20.7%; P<0.001), macrophage (77.8% versus 63.4%; P<0.001), microvessel (58.2% versus 42.9%; P<0.001), and cholesterol crystal (42.0% versus 26.7%; P<0.001) than the group with low NCP plaque volume. The group with high NCP volume also had higher PCAT attenuation than the group with low NCP volume (-69.6±10.0 versus -73.5±10.6 Hounsfield unit; P<0.001). In multivariable analysis, NCP volume was significantly associated with thin-cap fibroatheroma and high PCAT attenuation. In the analysis of the combination of PCAT attenuation and NCP volume, the prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma was the highest in the high PCAT attenuation and high NCP volume group and the lowest in the low PCAT attenuation and low NCP volume group. Higher NCP volume was associated with higher plaque vulnerability and vascular inflammation. The combination of PCAT attenuation and NCP volume may help identify plaque vulnerability noninvasively.
