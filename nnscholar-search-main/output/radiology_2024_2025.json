    "title": "Incorporating Lymph Node Size at CT as an N1 Descriptor in Clinical N Staging for Lung Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Background The ninth edition of the TNM classification for lung cancer revised the N2 categorization, improving patient stratification, but prognostic heterogeneity remains for the N1 category. Purpose To define the optimal size cutoff for a bulky lymph node (LN) on CT scans and to evaluate the prognostic value of bulky LN in the clinical N staging of lung cancer. Materials and Methods This retrospective study analyzed patients who underwent lobectomy or pneumonectomy for lung cancer between January 2013 and December 2021, divided into development (2016-2021) and validation (2013-2015) cohorts. The optimal threshold for a bulky LN was defined based on the short-axis diameter of the largest clinically positive LN at CT. Prognostic differences according to presence of bulky LN in cN1 category for overall survival (OS) were evaluated using multivariable Cox analysis. Survival discrimination was assessed using the Harrell concordance index (C-index). Results A total of 3426 patients (mean age, 64.0 years ± 9.3 [SD]; 1837 male) and 1327 patients (mean age, 63.0 years ± 9.7; 813 male) were included in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. The cutoff size for a bulky LN was established at 15 mm, and the presence of bulky LN was an independent risk factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.54; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.16; P = .01). In the development and validation cohorts, the cN1-bulky group had higher mortality risk than the cN1-nonbulky group (HR, 2.82 [95% CI: 1.73, 4.58; P < .001]; 2.29 [95% CI: 1.34, 3.92; P = .002], respectively). The bulky LN descriptor improved prognostic discrimination within the cN1 category compared with the current staging (C-index from 0.50 to 0.60 and to 0.58 in the development and validation cohorts [P < .001, P = .006], respectively]). Conclusion Defining bulky LN with a size cutoff of 15 mm was an effective descriptor in the clinical staging of N1 lung cancer. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Impact of Multimodal Prompt Elements on Diagnostic Performance of GPT-4V in Challenging Brain MRI Cases.",
    "abstract": "Background Studies have explored the application of multimodal large language models (LLMs) in radiologic differential diagnosis. Yet, how different multimodal input combinations affect diagnostic performance is not well understood. Purpose To evaluate the impact of varying multimodal input elements on the accuracy of OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V)-based brain MRI differential diagnosis. Materials and Methods Sixty brain MRI cases with a challenging yet verified diagnosis were selected. Seven prompt groups with variations of four input elements (image without modifiers [I], annotation [A], medical history [H], and image description [D]) were defined. For each MRI case and prompt group, three identical queries were performed using an LLM-based search engine (Perplexity AI, powered by GPT-4V). The accuracy of LLM-generated differential diagnoses was rated using a binary and a numeric scoring system and analyzed using a χ2 test and a Kruskal-Wallis test. Results were corrected for false-discovery rate with use of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Regression analyses were performed to determine the contribution of each input element to diagnostic performance. Results The prompt group containing I, A, H, and D as input exhibited the highest diagnostic accuracy (124 of 180 responses [69%]). Significant differences were observed between prompt groups that contained D among their inputs and those that did not. Unannotated (I) (four of 180 responses [2.2%]) or annotated radiologic images alone (I and A) (two of 180 responses [1.1%]) yielded very low diagnostic accuracy. Regression analyses confirmed a large positive effect of D on diagnostic accuracy (odds ratio [OR], 68.03; P < .001), as well as a moderate positive effect of H (OR, 4.18; P < .001). Conclusion The textual description of radiologic image findings was identified as the strongest contributor to the performance of GPT-4V in brain MRI differential diagnosis, followed by the medical history; unannotated or annotated images alone yielded very low diagnostic performance. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

Purpose To compare treatment effects and procedural safety of endovascular treatment (EVT) and best medical treatment (BMT) in patients with symptomatic acute occlusions of the ICA below the circle of Willis. Materials and Methods This retrospective, multicenter cohort study from 22 comprehensive stroke centers in Europe and Asia includes patients treated between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2022. Functional (modified Rankin Scale [mRS]) and clinical (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]) outcomes, safety measures (symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage), mortality, and procedural complications were assessed. Results A total 354 patients met the inclusion criteria (median age, 72 years [IQR, 60-81 years]; median NIHSS, 13 [IQR, 7-19]). Most frequent occlusions were in the C1 segment (243 of 354; 68.6%). Of 354 patients, 82.2% (291 patients) were administered EVT. In the overall population, favorable outcomes (mRS 0-2), mortality, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 40.6% (108 of 266 patients), 25.2% (67 of 266 patients), and 7.1% (25 of 350 patients), respectively. After adjustment, no statistically significant difference in functional outcome was observed (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.82 [95% CI: 0.31, 2.12]; average treatment effect, -12.7%; P = .19) in the EVT compared with BMT group. Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (average treatment effect, -0.28%; P = .95) and mortality did not differ between both groups (average treatment effect, -17.1%; P = .07). EVT resulted in complete recanalization of the occlusion in 80.9% (229 of 283) of cases. Periprocedural distal embolization occurred in 27.8% (81 of 291 patients) and was associated with poor outcomes (AOR, 0.41; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.93; P = .03). Conclusion EVT did not reveal a favorable treatment effect over BMT, and both therapies were safe. EVT had a risk for periprocedural distal embolization associated with poor outcomes. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "How I Do It: Management of Pleural-attached Pulmonary Nodules in Low-Dose CT Screening for Lung Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths globally. In various trials, the ability of low-dose CT screening to diagnose early lung cancers leads to high cure rates. It is widely accepted that the potential benefits of low-dose CT screening for lung cancer outweigh the harms. The ability to reliably predict the benignity of nodules, especially at the baseline round, further reduces the potential for harm. Pleural-attached nodules are an important subgroup that represents nodules attached (distance from any pleural surface, 0 mm) to any pleural surfaces (fissural, costal, mediastinal, and diaphragmatic). Pleural-attached solid nodules less than 10 mm in average diameter with smooth margins and triangular, lentiform, oval, or semicircular shapes have a high likelihood of benignity. The 2019 Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) version 1.1 assigned pleural-attached nodules with these features to categories 3 (probably benign, recommend follow-up in 6 months) or 4 (suspicious for malignancy, recommend follow-up in 3 months or PET/CT). However, Lung-RADS version 2022 now recommends annual follow-up rather than short-term follow-up. These changes downgrade these nodules to category 2 (benign) and limits additional workup. This review article summarizes the terminology used to describe these nodules, characteristics for determining benignity, and the accuracy of the evidence used to make these recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Staging of pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma is currently based on the Ann Arbor classification, incorporating the Cotswold modifications and the Lugano classification. The Cotswold modifications provide guidelines for the use of CT and MRI. The Lugano classification emphasizes the importance of CT and PET/CT in evaluating both Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma but focuses on adult patients. This article presents consensus guidelines that extend the traditional classifications used for adult Hodgkin lymphoma staging and provide rigorous definitions of lymph node groups based on MRI, CT, and fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT findings. This allows consistent terminology and definitions, using metabolic and morphologic imaging to identify affected lymph nodes or extranodal regions and organs. The pattern of involvement, together with other individual risk factors, determines treatment strategy. In case of inadequate response to chemotherapy, radiation therapy is often required. Standardization of staging definitions for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma is necessary for comparing treatment outcomes between North American and European clinical trials and a prerequisite for clear communication during tumor boards and central review. This comprehensive imaging atlas is intended to provide regional criteria for nodal involvement and to serve as a standardized guide for the anatomic assignment of lymph node involvement in pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma.",

    "abstract": "\"Just Accepted\" papers have undergone full peer review and have been accepted for publication in Radiology: Artificial Intelligence. This article will undergo copyediting, layout, and proof review before it is published in its final version. Please note that during production of the final copyedited article, errors may be discovered which could affect the content. Background Detection and segmentation of lung tumors on CT scans are critical for monitoring cancer progression, evaluating treatment responses, and planning radiation therapy; however, manual delineation is labor-intensive and subject to physician variability. Purpose To develop and evaluate an ensemble deep learning model for automating identification and segmentation of lung tumors on CT scans. Materials and Methods A retrospective study was conducted between July 2019 and November 2024 using a large dataset of CT simulation scans and clinical lung tumor segmentations from radiotherapy plans. This dataset was used to train a 3D U-Net-based, image-multiresolution ensemble model to detect and segment lung tumors on CT scans. Model performance was evaluated on internal and external test sets composed of CT simulation scans and lung tumor segmentations from two affiliated medical centers, including single primary and metastatic lung tumors. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, false positive rate, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Model-predicted tumor volumes were compared with physician-delineated volumes. Group comparisons were made with Wilcoxon signed-rank test or one-way ANOVA. P < 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results The model, trained on 1,504 CT scans with clinical lung tumor segmentations, achieved 92% sensitivity (92/100) and 82% specificity (41/50) in detecting lung tumors on the combined 150-CT scan test set. For a subset of 100 CT scans with a single lung tumor each, the model achieved a median model-physician DSC of 0.77 (IQR: 0.65-0.83) and an interphysician DSC of 0.80 (IQR: 0.72-0.86). Segmentation time was shorter for the model than for physicians (mean 76.6 vs. 166.1-187.7 seconds; p<0.001). Conclusion Routinely collected radiotherapy data were useful for model training. The key strengths of the model include a 3D U-Net ensemble approach for balancing volumetric context with resolution, robust tumor detection and segmentation performance, and the ability to generalize to an external site.",

    "title": "Contrast-enhanced US of High-Risk Indeterminate Focal Liver Observations Categorized as LR-4 or LR-M at CT/MRI.",
    "abstract": "Background Indeterminate focal liver observations in patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may require invasive biopsy or follow-up, which could lead to delays in definitive categorization and to postponement of treatment. Purpose To examine clinical effect of contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) in participants with high-risk indeterminate liver observations categorized as Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) category LR-4 (probably HCC) or LI-RADS category LR-M (probably or definitely malignant but not HCC specific) at CT or MRI. Materials and Methods This was a secondary analysis of a prospective international multicenter validation study for CEUS LI-RADS (January 2018 to August 2021). CEUS was performed within 4 weeks of CT or MRI. Tissue histologic and CT or MRI follow-up data were used as reference standards. Clinical effect of CEUS for HCC was evaluated in observations 10 mm or larger categorized as CT/MRI LR-4 and LR-M. Results Included were 109 participants (mean age, 64.3 years ± 8.3 [SD]; 68.8% [75 of 109] male participants) with 113 observations (≥10 mm) categorized as CT/MRI LR-4 (53.1%; 60 of 113) or LR-M (46.9%; 53 of 113). CEUS resulted in management recommendation changes in 33.6% (95% CI: 25, 43; 38 of 113) of observations; among these, 95% (95% CI: 82, 99; 36 of 38) were correct. A total of 30.1% (34 of 113) of CT/MRI LR-4 and LR-M observations were categorized at CEUS as LI-RADS category LR-5 (definite HCC), making biopsy unnecessary; 94% (32 of 34) of these categorizations were correct. Of CT/MRI LR-4 observations, 7% (four of 60) were categorized as CEUS LR-M; subsequent biopsy confirmed non-HCC malignancy in all participants. Clinical impact of CEUS was more substantial for observations 20 mm or larger (n = 68); CEUS helped appropriately categorize both LR-5 and LR-M lesions as HCC and non-HCC malignancies, respectively, and resulted in management recommendation changes in 40% (27 of 68) of observations with 100% accuracy. Conclusion CEUS resolved some high-risk indeterminate liver observations (categorized as LR-4 and LR-M at CT or MRI), with particularly high clinical impact for observations measuring at least 20 mm.

    "abstract": "Background Detection of hepatic metastases at CT is a daily task in radiology departments that influences medical and surgical treatment strategies for oncology patients. Purpose To compare simulated photon-counting CT (PCCT) with energy-integrating detector (EID) CT for the detection of small liver lesions. Materials and Methods In this reader study (July to December 2023), a virtual imaging framework was used with 50 anthropomorphic phantoms and 183 generated liver lesions (one to six lesions per phantom, 0.4-1.5 cm in diameter). Virtual CT platforms simulated PCCT and EID CT scanners. Phantoms were virtually scanned using routine (6 mGy) and low-dose (1.5 mGy) conditions and reconstructed with three kernels. A subset of 300 scans (150 PCCT vs EID CT pairs) were selected. Four radiologists independently reviewed all scans to mark liver lesions, assigned confidence scores for detection, and rated scan quality. Analysis was performed on a per-lesion basis to determine sensitivity for several variables and on a per-scan basis for scan quality. The McNemar test, two-sided paired t tests, and mixed-effects logistic regression models were fitted; P < .05 was considered indicative of statistically significant difference. Results Consensus reader sensitivity in detecting lesions was 82.1% (451 of 549) for PCCT versus 77.6% (426 of 549) for EID CT (P < .001), with a mean sensitivity gain of 4.3 percentage points ± 1.3 (P < .001 to P = .02 per reader). Readers had better subjective confidence for lesions at PCCT (mean score, 61.5 ± 22 vs 56.1 ± 24 [on a 101-point scale]; P < .001). Sensitivity was lower for lesions smaller than 1 cm, with more pronounced difference between PCCT and EID CT (74.0% [271 of 366] vs 67.2% [246 of 366]; P < .001). At the lower dose level, PCCT showed higher sensitivity than EID CT (68.9% [168 of 244] vs 61.1% [149 of 244]; P < .001) for subcentimeter lesions. In a multivariable model, PCCT was independently associated with increased odds of lesion detection (odds ratio, 1.55; P < .001). Image quality was slightly higher for PCCT (mean score, 55.3 vs 50.6 [on a 101-point scale]; P < .001). Conclusion Compared with EID CT, PCCT showed better sensitivity in the detection of small liver lesions. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Deep Learning to Simulate Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Evaluating Suspected Prostate Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Background Multiparametric MRI, including contrast-enhanced sequences, is recommended for evaluating suspected prostate cancer, but concerns have been raised regarding potential contrast agent accumulation and toxicity. Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of generating simulated contrast-enhanced MRI from noncontrast MRI sequences using deep learning and to explore their potential value for assessing clinically significant prostate cancer using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.1. Materials and Methods Male patients with suspected prostate cancer who underwent multiparametric MRI were retrospectively included from three centers from April 2020 to April 2023. A deep learning model (pix2pix algorithm) was trained to synthesize contrast-enhanced MRI scans from four noncontrast MRI sequences (T1-weighted imaging, T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps) and then tested on an internal and two external datasets. The reference standard for model training was the second postcontrast phase of the dynamic contrast-enhanced sequence. Similarity between simulated and acquired contrast-enhanced images was evaluated using the multiscale structural similarity index. Three radiologists independently scored T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI with either simulated or acquired contrast-enhanced images using PI-RADS, version 2.1; agreement was assessed with Cohen κ. Results A total of 567 male patients (mean age, 66 years ± 11 [SD]) were divided into a training test set (n = 244), internal test set (n = 104), external test set 1 (n = 143), and external test set 2 (n = 76). Simulated and acquired contrast-enhanced images demonstrated high similarity (multiscale structural similarity index: 0.82, 0.71, and 0.69 for internal test set, external test set 1, and external test set 2, respectively) with excellent reader agreement of PI-RADS scores (Cohen κ, 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.98). When simulated contrast-enhanced imaging was added to biparametric MRI, 34 of 323 (10.5%) patients were upgraded to PI-RADS 4 from PI-RADS 3. Conclusion It was feasible to generate simulated contrast-enhanced prostate MRI using deep learning. The simulated and acquired contrast-enhanced MRI scans exhibited high similarity and demonstrated excellent agreement in assessing clinically significant prostate cancer based on PI-RADS, version 2.1. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Purpose To identify radiologic features for predicting ALI in NSCLCs 30 mm or smaller in maximum diameter. Materials and Methods This study was a secondary review of pathologic and CT findings from an integrated health care system between January 2016 and November 2023 for participants in the prospective study Initiative for Early Lung Cancer Research on Treatment, or IELCART. Preoperative diagnostic radiologic features possibly related to ALI, volume doubling time (VDT), and PET maximum standardized uptake value were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusted for sex, age, nodule size, and smoking status, was used to determine predictors of ALI. Model performance was analyzed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results Of 778 resected NSCLCs 30 mm or smaller (median patient age, 69 years [IQR, 63-76 years]; 458 female patients), 715 (92%) were solid, 41 (5%) were part-solid, and 22 (3%) were nonsolid. ALI was documented in 271 (35%) resected NSCLCs, all in solid NSCLCs, representing 37.9% (95% CI: 34.4, 41.5) of solid NSCLCs. None of the 63 subsolid NSCLCs had ALI (0% [95% CI: 0, 5.75]). For the 715 solid NSCLCs (median patient age, 69 years [IQR, 63-76 years]; 420 female patients), multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that lollipop sign (odds ratio [OR] = 4.12 [95% CI: 2.82, 6.04]; P < .001) and spiculation (OR = 2.05 [95% CI: 1.42, 2.97]; P < .001) were independent predictors of ALI (AUC = 0.77 [95% CI: 0.73, 0.80]). Considering only the 474 patients in whom VDT could be calculated based on CT scans, VDT was also an independent predictor for ALI (OR = 0.96 [95% CI: 0.94, 0.98]; P < .001). Incorporating VDT into the model improved ALI prediction (AUC = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.77, 0.86]; P < .001). Conclusion For patients with NSCLCs 30 mm or smaller, ALI was present in 37.9% of solid NSCLCs and none of the 63 subsolid NSCLCs. Among solid NSCLCs, lollipop sign, spiculation, and VDT were independent radiologic predictors of ALI. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Multimodality imaging is essential for personalized prognostic stratification in suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Machine learning (ML) methods can help address this complexity by incorporating a broader spectrum of variables. Purpose To investigate the performance of an ML model that uses both stress cardiac MRI and coronary CT angiography (CCTA) data to predict major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with newly diagnosed CAD. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive symptomatic patients without known CAD referred for CCTA between December 2008 and January 2020. Patients with obstructive CAD (at least one ≥50% stenosis at CCTA) underwent stress cardiac MRI for functional assessment. Eighteen clinical, two electrocardiogram, nine CCTA, and 12 cardiac MRI parameters were evaluated as inputs for the ML model, which involved automated feature selection with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm and model building with an XGBoost algorithm. The primary outcome was MACE, defined as a composite of cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. External testing was performed using two independent datasets. Performance was compared between the ML model and existing scores and other approaches using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results Of 2210 patients who completed cardiac MRI, 2038 (mean age, 70 years ± 12 [SD]; 1091 [53.5%] female participants) completed follow-up (median duration, 7 years [IQR, 6-9 years]); 281 experienced MACE (13.8%). The ML model exhibited a higher AUC (0.86) for MACE prediction than the European Society of Cardiology score (0.55), QRISK3 score (0.60), Framingham Risk Score (0.50), segment involvement score (0.71), CCTA data alone (0.76), or stress cardiac MRI data alone (0.83) (P value range, <.001 to .004). The ML model also exhibited good performance in the two external validation datasets (AUC, 0.84 and 0.92). Conclusion An ML model including both CCTA and stress cardiac MRI data demonstrated better performance in predicting MACE than traditional methods and existing scores in patients with newly diagnosed CAD. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "title": "Privacy-ensuring Open-weights Large Language Models Are Competitive with Closed-weights GPT-4o in Extracting Chest Radiography Findings from Free-Text Reports.",
    "abstract": "Background Large-scale secondary use of clinical databases requires automated tools for retrospective extraction of structured content from free-text radiology reports. Purpose To share data and insights on the application of privacy-preserving open-weights large language models (LLMs) for reporting content extraction with comparison to standard rule-based systems and the closed-weights LLMs from OpenAI. Materials and Methods In this retrospective exploratory study conducted between May 2024 and September 2024, zero-shot prompting of 17 open-weights LLMs was preformed. These LLMs with model weights released under open licenses were compared with rule-based annotation and with OpenAI's GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-3.5-turbo on a manually annotated public English chest radiography dataset (Indiana University, 3927 patients and reports). An annotated nonpublic German chest radiography dataset (18 500 reports, 16 844 patients [10 340 male; mean age, 62.6 years ± 21.5 {SD}]) was used to compare local fine-tuning of all open-weights LLMs via low-rank adaptation and 4-bit quantization to bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) with different subsets of reports (from 10 to 14 580). Nonoverlapping 95% CIs of macro-averaged F1 scores were defined as relevant differences. Results For the English reports, the highest zero-shot macro-averaged F1 score was observed for GPT-4o (92.4% [95% CI: 87.9, 95.9]); GPT-4o outperformed the rule-based CheXpert [Stanford University] (73.1% [95% CI: 65.1, 79.7]) but was comparable in performance to several open-weights LLMs (top three: Mistral-Large [Mistral AI], 92.6% [95% CI: 88.2, 96.0]; Llama-3.1-70b [Meta AI], 92.2% [95% CI: 87.1, 95.8]; and Llama-3.1-405b [Meta AI]: 90.3% [95% CI: 84.6, 94.5]). For the German reports, Mistral-Large (91.6% [95% CI: 90.5, 92.7]) had the highest zero-shot macro-averaged F1 score among the six other open-weights LLMs and outperformed the rule-based annotation (74.8% [95% CI: 73.3, 76.1]). Using 1000 reports for fine-tuning, all LLMs (top three: Mistral-Large, 94.3% [95% CI: 93.5, 95.2]; OpenBioLLM-70b [Saama]: 93.9% [95% CI: 92.9, 94.8]; and Mixtral-8×22b [Mistral AI]: 93.8% [95% CI: 92.8, 94.7]) achieved significantly higher macro-averaged F1 score than did BERT (86.7% [95% CI: 85.0, 88.3]); however, the differences were not relevant when 2000 or more reports were used for fine-tuning. Conclusion LLMs have the potential to outperform rule-based systems for zero-shot \"out-of-the-box\" structuring of report databases, with privacy-ensuring open-weights LLMs being competitive with closed-weights GPT-4o. Additionally, the open-weights LLM outperformed BERT when moderate numbers of reports were used for fine-tuning. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

    "abstract": "Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests are already being marketed as noninvasive, convenient opportunities to test for multiple cancer types with a single blood sample. The technology varies-involving detection of circulating tumor DNA, fragments of DNA, RNA, or proteins unique to each targeted cancer. The priorities and tradeoffs of reaching diagnostic resolution in the setting of possible false positives and negatives remain under active study. Given the well-established role of imaging in lesion detection and characterization for most cancers, radiologists have an essential role to play in selecting diagnostic pathways, determining the validity of test results, resolving false-positive MCED test results, and evaluating tradeoffs for clinical policy. Appropriate access to and use of imaging tests will also factor into clinical guidelines. Thus, all clinicians potentially involved with MCED tests for cancer screening will need to weigh the benefits and harms of MCED testing, including consideration of how the tests will be used alongside or in place of other screening options, how diagnostic confirmation tests should be selected, and what the implications are for policy and reimbursement decisions. Further, patients will need regular support to make informed decisions about screening using MCED tests in the context of their personal cancer risks, health-related values, and access to care.",

Purpose To investigate the association between postoperative surveillance breast MRI and advanced second breast cancer in women with a PHBC by using propensity score matching (PSM). Materials and Methods Women who underwent breast cancer surgery between January 2009 and December 2014 were retrospectively identified at a single tertiary center. Second breast cancer was defined as ipsilateral or contralateral breast cancer diagnosed at least 1 year after surgery, and advanced second breast cancer was defined as second breast cancer (a) grade T2 or higher or lymph node-positive or (b) T1c triple-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive. Women who underwent surveillance MRI and those who did not were matched using propensity scores according to 13 clinical-pathologic characteristics. Outcomes were compared using logistic regression analysis. Results Among the 3688 women (mean age, 51.1 years ± 10.5 [SD]), 2130 underwent surveillance MRI (MRI group) and 1558 did not (non-MRI group); 1062 patient pairs were matched. Advanced second breast cancer proportions for non-MRI and MRI groups were 1.7% (27 of 1558 participants) and 0.4% (eight of 2130 participants) before PSM and 1.6% (17 of 1062 participants) and 0.7% (seven of 1062) after PSM. Surveillance MRI was associated with lower odds of advanced second breast cancer before PSM (odds ratio [OR], 0.21 [95% CI: 0.10, 0.47]; P < .001) and after PSM (OR, 0.41 [95% CI: 0.17, 0.99]; P = .048). The proportion of symptomatic second breast cancers was higher in the non-MRI group before PSM (25% [16 of 65 second cancers] vs 6.4% [three of 47]; P = .01) and after PSM (21% [10 of 48] vs 3.2% [one of 31]; P = .003).

    "title": "MRI of the Rectum: A Decade into DISTANCE, Moving to DISTANCED.",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, advancements in rectal cancer research have reshaped treatment paradigms. Historically, treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer has focused on neoadjuvant long-course chemoradiotherapy, followed by total mesorectal excision. Interest in organ preservation strategies has been strengthened by the introduction of total neoadjuvant therapy with improved rates of complete clinical response. The administration of systemic induction chemotherapy and consolidation chemoradiotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting has introduced a new dimension to the treatment landscape and patients now face a more intricate decision-making process, given the expanded therapeutic options. This complexity underlines the importance of shared decision-making and brings to light the crucial role of radiologists. MRI, especially high-spatial-resolution T2-weighted imaging, is heralded as the reference standard for rectal cancer management because of its exceptional ability to provide staging and prognostic insights. A key evolution in MRI interpretation for rectal cancer is the transition from the DISTANCE mnemonic to the more encompassing DISTANCED-DIS, distal tumor boundary; T, T stage; A, anal sphincter complex; N, nodal status; C, circumferential resection margin; E, extramural venous invasion; D, tumor deposits. This nuanced shift in the mnemonic captures a wider range of diagnostic indicators. It also emphasizes the escalating role of radiologists in steering well-informed decisions in the realm of rectal cancer care.",

    "abstract": "Background Ischemic late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) assessed with cardiac MRI is a well-established prognosticator in ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, the prognostic value of additional LGE parameters, such as extent, transmurality, location, and associated midwall LGE, remains unclear. Purpose To assess the prognostic value of ischemic LGE features to predict all-cause mortality in ischemic cardiomyopathy. Materials and Methods This study is a secondary analysis of a prospective dual-center trial of participants with ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) under 50% referred for viability assessment using cardiac MRI between 2008 and 2022. The LGE granularity parameters (extent of ischemic LGE, transmurality, location, and associated midwall LGE) assessed by cardiac MRI experts were compared with traditional prognosticators of adverse events in ischemic cardiomyopathy (age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, heart failure hospitalization, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, known myocardial infarction, and LVEF). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Predictive value was evaluated using Cox regression analysis and assessed using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves at 10 years. The cardiac MRI LGE score was developed using LGE granularity parameters. Results Among 6082 participants (mean age, 64.5 years ± 11.8 [SD]; 4419 men), 3591 had ischemic LGE. During a median follow-up of 9.0 years (IQR, 6.6-11.5 years), 652 participants died. The presence of ischemic LGE was strongly associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 3.45 [99.5% CI: 2.55, 4.67]; P < .001). In the group with ischemic LGE, the LGE granularity model combining these LGE features showed the best predictive value above traditional prognosticators and ischemic LGE extent to predict all-cause mortality (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve [AUC] at 10 years, 0.89 [99.5% CI: 0.89, 0.90] vs 0.83 [99.5% CI: 0.83, 0.84]; P < .001). The cardiac MRI LGE score performed well in participants with ischemic LGE (AUC at 10 years, 0.87 [99.5% CI: 0.85, 0.90]). Conclusion In a large cohort of participants with ischemic cardiomyopathy, an LGE granularity model had a higher prognostic value over traditional prognosticators to predict mortality. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Purpose To compare the clinical outcomes of best medical management (BMM) alone versus BMM and early EVT (door-to-puncture time [DPT] ≤ 120 minutes) versus BMM and late EVT (DPT > 120 minutes) in patients with VBAO who have NIHSS scores of 10 or less at admission. Materials and Methods This retrospective study evaluated patients with VBAO and admission NIHSS score of 10 or less who were seen at 65 stroke centers in China from December 2015 to June 2022. The primary outcome was whether the patient achieved a favorable functional outcome (a modified Rankin scale [mRS] score of 0-3 at 90 days). Adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the association between treatment (BMM alone vs early EVT and BMM vs late EVT and BMM) and outcomes. Results Among 1365 patients (mean age ± SD, 65 years ± 12; 951 male) with VBAO and an NIHSS score of 10 or less at admission, 489 patients (35.8%) received EVT. Of these, 382 (78.1%) received early EVT, and 107 (21.9%) received late EVT. After adjustment for confounders, compared with BMM alone, early EVT plus BMM was associated with increased rates of favorable functional outcome (odds ratio [OR], 1.41 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.87]; P = .02), whereas late EVT plus BMM did not outperform BMM alone (OR, 0.83 [95% CI: 0.54, 1.28]; P = .39). Conclusion In patients with VBAO admitted with an NIHSS score of 10 or less, early EVT (DPT ≤ 120 minutes) combined with BMM outperformed BMM alone, whereas late EVT (DPT > 120 minutes) combined with BMM did not outperform BMM alone. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

Purpose To assess the response of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels to US-guided parathyroid MWA and RFA and the safety of these treatments in participants with SHPT. Materials and Methods This prospective multicenter cohort study, conducted from September 2017 to March 2022, included participants with SHPT. The primary end point was the proportion of participants achieving the target PTH level (≤585 pg/mL). The secondary end points included PTH, calcium, phosphorus, and ALP levels before ablation and time points for follow-up assessments after ablation (2 hours, 1 day, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, and then every 6 months) and complications and technical success rates. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with treatment failure. Results A total of 215 participants (median age, 53 years [IQR, 43-60 years]; 109 [50.7%] male participants) were evaluated, and 183 (85.1%) achieved target PTH levels. Compared with baseline levels, there was an 85.9%, 6.3%, 15.3%, and 37.4% reduction in PTH, calcium, phosphorus, and ALP levels at 24 months after ablation, respectively. For major complications, one (0.5%) participant experienced persistent hoarseness, and severe hypocalcemia (<1.87 mmol/L) was present in 74 (34.4%) participants. After adjustments, predictors associated with treatment failure included the preablation PTH level (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.78; 95% CI: 1.19, 12.04; P = .03), maximum tumor volume (adjusted OR, 5.02; 95% CI: 1.74, 14.53; P = .003), and number of glands ablated (adjusted OR, 0.32; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.98; P = .046). The prediction model showed good discrimination ability in the development and validation cohorts (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.78 [95% CI: 0.66, 0.90] and 0.73 [95% CI: 0.55, 0.91], respectively). Conclusion US-guided thermal ablation techniques were effective and safe treatments in participants with SHPT because they effectively reduced PTH, calcium, phosphorus, and ALP levels. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background MRI-guided focal laser ablation (FLA) is a promising treatment in localized prostate cancer (PCa). MRI-guided micro-US FLA shows potential for outpatient use, but its clinical application remains unexplored. Purpose To evaluate the safety, feasibility, and 12-month functional and oncologic outcomes of MRI-guided micro-US transperineal FLA in localized PCa and to assess the accuracy of micro-US in showing lesions depicted at MRI with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score of 3 or higher. Materials and Methods This prospective, single-center observational study (July 2020 to June 2023) included participants with localized low- or intermediate-risk PCa and PI-RADS 3 or higher lesions (≤20 mm). Single- or multifiber FLA was performed at 1064 nm, guided by MRI-delineated image fusion. At 12 months, recurrence rates, complications, erectile function scores, and urinary symptom scores were assessed. Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests were used for comparisons. Results Fifty-five male participants (median age, 70 years; IQR, 62-74 years) with 58 lesions that were PI-RADS 3 or higher underwent transperineal FLA, with a 12-month follow-up for 33 participants. The median prostate-specific antigen level was 7.0 ng/mL (IQR, 5.6-9.0 ng/mL), 43 of 58 lesions (74%) had a Gleason score of 3 + 4, and 10 of 58 lesions (17%) had a Gleason score of 3 + 3. Single-fiber and multifiber FLA were used to treat 21 of 58 (36%) and 37 of 58 (64%) tumors, respectively. At micro-US, 53 of 58 (91%) tumors were successfully visualized. Multifiber FLA produced larger ablation volumes than did single-fiber treatment (median, 15 mL [IQR, 8-22 mL] vs 4.5 mL [IQR, 2.8-9.2 mL]; P < .001). At 12 months, biopsies in 35 treated tumors showed 17 recurrences (49%), including 13 in-field and four out-of-field recurrences. In-field recurrences occurred in 10 of 18 (56%) single-fiber and three of 17 (18%) multifiber cases. At 12 months, erectile function scores decreased compared with baseline (median International Index of Erectile Function score, 19 [IQR, 12-24] vs 21 [IQR, 15-24]; P < .001), whereas urinary function remained stable (median International Prostatic Symptom Score, 2 [IQR, 2-9] vs 6 [IQR, 3-11]; P = .72). One rectoprostatic fistula developed and required surgery. Conclusion Multifiber micro-US-guided FLA was safe and feasible, with 18% recurrence at 1-year follow-up. Clinical trial registration no.

    "abstract": "Background Emerging evidence suggests mitochondrial dysfunction may play a role in the fatigue experienced by individuals with post-COVID-19 condition (PCC), commonly called long COVID, which can be assessed using MR spectroscopy. Purpose To compare mitochondrial function between participants with fatigue-predominant PCC and healthy control participants using MR spectroscopy, and to investigate the relationship between MR spectroscopic parameters and fatigue using the 11-item Chalder fatigue questionnaire. Materials and Methods This prospective, observational, single-center study (June 2021 to January 2024) included participants with PCC who reported moderate to severe fatigue, with normal blood test and echocardiographic results, alongside control participants without fatigue symptoms. MR spectroscopy was performed using a 3-T MRI system, measuring hydrogen 1 (1H) and phosphorus 31 (31P) during exercise and recovery in the gastrocnemius muscle. General linear models were used to compare the phosphocreatine recovery rate time constant (hereafter, τPCr) and maximum oxidative flux, also known as mitochondrial capacity (hereafter, Qmax), between groups. Pearson correlations were used to assess the relationship between MR spectroscopic parameters and fatigue scores. Results A total of 41 participants with PCC (mean age, 44 years ± 9 [SD]; 23 male) (mean body mass index [BMI], 26 ± 4) and 29 healthy control participants (mean age, 34 years ± 11; 18 male) (mean BMI, 23 ± 3) were included in the study. Participants with PCC showed higher resting phosphocreatine levels (mean difference, 4.10 mmol/L; P = .03). Following plantar flexion exercise in situ (3-5 minutes), participants with PCC had a higher τPCr (92.5 seconds ± 35.3) compared with controls (51.9 seconds ± 31.9) (mean difference, 40.6; 95% CI: 24.3, 56.6; P ≤ .001), and Qmax was higher in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.16 mmol/L per second (95% CI: 0.07, 0.26; P = .008). There was no correlation between MR spectroscopic parameters and fatigue scores (r ≤ 0.25 and P ≥ .10 for all). Conclusion Participants with PCC showed differences in τPCr and Qmax compared with healthy controls, suggesting potential mitochondrial dysfunction. This finding did not correlate with fatigue scores. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license. Supplemental material is available for this article.

Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility of neoadjuvant chemotherapy Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (nacVI-RADS) scores and posttreatment Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) scores when assessing MIBC response to neoadjuvant immunotherapy with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). Materials and Methods A retrospective analysis of MRI scans was conducted in patients enrolled in the PURE-01 study (NCT02736266) from February 2017 to December 2019 who underwent pre- and postimmunotherapy mpMRI before radical cystectomy. Five readers independently reviewed the scans using VI-RADS and nacVI-RADS criteria. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated for each reader, and the final histopathologic diagnosis served as the reference standard. Interreader agreement was assessed with the percentage of agreement, Conger κ, and Gwet agreement coefficient AC1. Results A total of 110 patients (median age, 67 years [IQR: 61-74]; 96 male) with 220 MRI scans were included; 80 (73%) patients had pure urothelial carcinoma. A total of 46 of 110 (42%) patients achieved a complete pathologic response. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of nacVI-RADS 3 or higher for detecting residual disease (higher than stage ypT0) at radical cystectomy were 67%-84%, 63%-96%, and 63%-75%, respectively; for residual muscle-invasive disease (higher than stage ypT1), these values were 91%-98%, 55%-94%, and 93%-98%, respectively. The accuracy of nacVI-RADS was 72%-81% for stage ypT0 or higher disease and 71%-95% for stage ypT1 or higher disease. The accuracy of VI-RADS 3 or higher was 80%-95% for stage ypT1 or higher disease. The percentage of agreement for nacVI-RADS scores was 82% (κ = 0.62-0.65; AC1 = 0.65).

    "abstract": "Background Prediction of the tumor growth rates is clinically important in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but previous studies have presented conflicting results and generally lacked radiologic evaluations. Purpose To evaluate the percentage of rapidly growing early-stage HCCs in each Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) category and to identify prognostic factors associated with rapid growth. Materials and Methods Retrospective study of patients with risk factors for HCC and those with surgically proven early-stage HCC who underwent two or more preoperative multiphasic CT or MRI examinations between January 2016 and December 2020. LI-RADS categories were assigned according to the baseline CT or MRI results. The tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) was calculated from the tumor volumes measured at the two examinations. The growth rate was classified as rapid (TVDT < 3 months), intermediate (TVDT = 3-9 months), or indolent (TVDT > 9 months). The percentage of rapidly growing HCCs was compared among the LI-RADS categories, and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with rapidly growing HCC. Results In 322 patients (mean age, 61 years ± 9 [SD]; 249 men) with 345 HCCs (30 LR-3, 64 LR-4, 221 LR-5, and 30 LR-M category), the median TVDT of HCC was 131 days (IQR, 87-233) and 27.0% of HCCs showed rapid growth. The growth rates differed among the LI-RADS categories, with a higher percentage of rapidly growing HCCs observed for LR-M HCCs than for LR-3 (70.0% vs 3.3%, P < .001), LR-4 (70.0% vs 12.5%, P < .001), or LR-5 (70.0% vs 28.5%, P < .001) HCCs. An α-fetoprotein level greater than 400 ng/mL (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.54; 95% CI: 1.16, 5.54; P = .02), baseline tumor diameter (adjusted OR, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.87; P = .004), and LR-M category (adjusted OR, 9.26; 95% CI: 3.70, 23.16; P < .001) were independently associated with higher odds of rapid growth. Conclusion Among early-stage HCCs, LR-M category was an independent factor for rapid growth, observed in 70% of HCCs. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background Pulmonary function tests are central to diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory diseases but do not provide information on regional lung function heterogeneity. Fluorine 19 (19F) MRI of inhaled perfluoropropane permits quantitative and spatially localized assessment of pulmonary ventilation properties without tracer gas hyperpolarization. Purpose To assess regional lung ventilation properties using 19F MRI of inhaled perfluoropropane in participants with asthma, participants with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and healthy participants, including quantitative evaluation of bronchodilator response in participants with respiratory disease. Materials and Methods This prospective, dual-center study included participants with asthma or COPD from July 2019 to September 2022 and healthy participants from May 2018 to June 2019. Participants underwent conventional spirometry, proton MRI, and 19F MRI following inhalation of a 79% perfluoropropane and 21% oxygen gas mixture. Three-dimensional 19F MRI scans were acquired during a single breath hold. For participants with asthma or COPD, spirometric and MRI measurements were repeated following administration of nebulized salbutamol. Ventilation defect percentage (VDP) was calculated from perfluoropropane distribution. Linear mixed-effects models were used to assess differences in VDP between participant groups and before and after bronchodilator administration. Results Thirty-five participants with asthma (mean age, 50 years ± 18 [SD]; 21 male participants), 21 participants with COPD (mean age, 69 years ± 6; 14 male participants), and 38 healthy participants (mean age, 41 years ± 11; 20 male participants) were evaluated. 19F MRI-derived VDP was elevated in participants with COPD (geometric mean, 27.2%) and participants with asthma (geometric mean, 8.3%) compared with healthy participants (geometric mean, 1.8%; geometric mean ratio, 15.2 [95% CI: 11.1, 20.6] for COPD and 4.6 [95% CI: 3.2, 6.6] for asthma; P < .001 for both). After bronchodilator administration, VDP was reduced by 33% in participants with asthma (from 8.3% to 5.6%) and 14% in participants with COPD (from 27.2% to 23.3%; P < .001 for both). Conclusion 19F MRI of inhaled perfluoropropane was sensitive to changes in regional ventilation properties associated with lung disease and enabled quantification of changes following bronchodilator therapy.

The patient underwent surveillance imaging 7 months after initiation of treatment with maximum-dose pazopanib and less than 1 month after completing a 2-month regimen of palliative stereotactic body radiation therapy to the right nephrectomy bed and site of recurrence. (Stereotactic body radiation therapy was initiated 5 months after pazopanib treatment was initiated.) One month after initiating treatment with pazopanib and 6 months before the surveillance imaging, the patient developed diarrhea and required ongoing treatment with loperamide to control symptoms. He denied any fatigue, mouth sores, or extremity pain, but described some abdominal pain and discomfort associated with the diarrhea. He was not experiencing any fevers, and vital signs were normal. White blood cell count was normal at 5100/μL (5.1 ×109/L) (reference range, 4200-10 200/μL [4.2-10.2 ×109/L]), with all components of the differential count also being normal.

Because of limited availability of human translators with medical expertise, large language models (LLMs) are a promising solution, but their ability to translate radiology reports remains largely unexplored. Purpose To evaluate the accuracy and quality of various LLMs in translating radiology reports across high-resource languages (English, Italian, French, German, and Chinese) and low-resource languages (Swedish, Turkish, Russian, Greek, and Thai). Materials and Methods A dataset of 100 synthetic free-text radiology reports from CT and MRI scans was translated by 18 radiologists between January 14 and May 2, 2024, into nine target languages. Ten LLMs, including GPT-4 (OpenAI), Llama 3 (Meta), and Mixtral models (Mistral AI), were used for automated translation. Translation accuracy and quality were assessed with use of BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) score, translation error rate (TER), and CHaRacter-level F-score (chrF++) metrics. Statistical significance was evaluated with use of paired t tests with Holm-Bonferroni corrections. Radiologists also conducted a qualitative evaluation of translations with use of a standardized questionnaire. Results GPT-4 demonstrated the best overall translation quality, particularly from English to German (BLEU score: 35.0 ± 16.3 [SD]; TER: 61.7 ± 21.2; chrF++: 70.6 ± 9.4), to Greek (BLEU: 32.6 ± 10.1; TER: 52.4 ± 10.6; chrF++: 62.8 ± 6.4), to Thai (BLEU: 53.2 ± 7.3; TER: 74.3 ± 5.2; chrF++: 48.4 ± 6.6), and to Turkish (BLEU: 35.5 ± 6.6; TER: 52.7 ± 7.4; chrF++: 70.7 ± 3.7). GPT-3.5 showed highest accuracy in translations from English to French, and Qwen1.5 excelled in English-to-Chinese translations, whereas Mixtral 8x22B performed best in Italian-to-English translations. The qualitative evaluation revealed that LLMs excelled in clarity, readability, and consistency with the original meaning but showed moderate medical terminology accuracy. Conclusion LLMs showed high accuracy and quality for translating radiology reports, although results varied by model and language pair. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, present substantial therapeutic challenges due to their high morbidity, mortality, and increasing prevalence. Current treatments often prove infeasible or inadequate in patients with refractory VAs. Purpose To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of CT-guided left stellate ganglion cryoneurolysis (SGC) in the treatment of refractory VAs. Materials and Methods This retrospective study reviewed all consecutive patients with refractory VAs who underwent SGC between June 2020 and December 2023 at two tertiary care centers. Patients with refractory VAs who underwent CT-guided left SGC were included. No patients were excluded. Data on preprocedural clinical status, procedural approach, procedural outcomes, and adverse events were analyzed. The pre- and postprocedural number of defibrillations were compared using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Results A total of 17 patients (mean age, 60.4 years ± 2.7 [standard error of the mean]; 14 male) were included; seven patients (41%) were receiving β-adrenergic blocking agents. The mean number of antiarrhythmic medications per patient was 2.2 ± 0.2. CT-guided left SGC led to a significant reduction in defibrillations, from a median of 3 (IQR, 3-15) to 0 (IRQ, 0-0) in the 24 hours before and after the procedure, respectively (P < .001). Clinical success, defined as freedom from defibrillation within the preceding 24-hour period, was achieved in 14 of 17 patients (82%) 24 hours after and 15 of 17 patients (88%) 72 hours after the procedure. Of 17 patients, 12 (71%) proceeded to additional procedural management after SGC. At a mean follow-up of 469.2 days ± 90.8, 14 of 17 patients (82%) were alive. No moderate or high-grade adverse events were observed; mild adverse events included left upper extremity neurapraxia (n = 1) and transient Horner syndrome (n = 3). Conclusion CT-guided left SGC demonstrated promising effectiveness and safety in treating patients with refractory VAs. Thus, SGC warrants consideration for inclusion in a multidisciplinary treatment algorithm for VAs. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Cadour and Scemama in this issue.",

    "title": "Osteochondral Abnormalities on Three-Dimensional Ultrashort Echo Time MRI Scans Are Associated with Knee Cartilage Degradation.",
    "abstract": "Background The calcified cartilage layer and subchondral bone plate (SBP) contribute to osteoarthritis development. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrashort echo-time (UTE) MRI can help to evaluate calcified cartilage and SBP in various stages of cartilage degradation. Purpose To compare calcified cartilage and SBP abnormalities using 3D UTE MRI with cartilage degradation and osteochondral junction (OCJ) abnormalities observed at proton-density fast spin-echo with fat suppression (PDFS) MRI. Materials and Methods Between April 2018 and March 2019, 143 participants were prospectively enrolled in this study and underwent routine knee MRI with an additional sagittal 3D UTE MRI examination for chronic knee pain. The MRI scans were retrospectively analyzed by two musculoskeletal radiologists independently and at consensus. Cartilage degradation grades and OCJ abnormalities were evaluated at PDFS MRI. Calcified cartilage and SBP abnormalities were assessed at 3D UTE MRI by considering the location of cartilage degradation. The relationship between cartilage degradation grade and abnormalities of calcified cartilage and SBP was assessed using Spearman rank correlation analysis. The association between OCJ abnormalities on PDFS MRI scans and calcified cartilage and SBP abnormalities was analyzed using logistic regression models. Results In total, 143 knees (71 right and 72 left knees) from 143 participants (mean age, 50.8 years ± 17.6 [SD]; 72 male and 71 female participants) were analyzed. On 3D UTE MRI scans, calcified cartilage defects showed a moderate positive correlation with the cartilage degradation grade (ρ = 0.49-0.52; P < .001). Calcified cartilage thinning (ρ = 0.2-0.3; P < .001), SBP irregular thickening (ρ = 0.3-0.35; P < .001), and defects (ρ = 0.34-0.42; P < .001) exhibited a weak positive correlation with the cartilage degradation grade. OCJ abnormalities depicted at PDFS MRI were associated with calcified cartilage and SBP abnormalities (P < .05). Conclusion Calcified cartilage layer and SBP abnormalities at 3D UTE MRI were associated with cartilage degradation and OCJ abnormalities depicted at PDFS MRI. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "title": "Diagnostic Accuracy and Value of CXCR4-targeted PET/MRI Using 68Ga-Pentixafor for Tumor Localization in Cushing Disease.",
    "abstract": "Background Gallium 68 (68Ga) pentixafor has emerged as a potential C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)-targeted radiotracer for neuroendocrine tumor, yet its application in Cushing disease remains uncertain. Purpose To assess the diagnostic accuracy and value of 68Ga-pentixafor PET/MRI in localizing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary tumors in Cushing disease. Materials and Methods A prospective single-center study was conducted from March 2023 to February 2024 in participants with Cushing disease scheduled for surgical pituitary tumor resection. All participants underwent preoperative 68Ga-pentixafor PET/MRI and contrast-enhanced MRI. Two radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians analyzed images. Surgical and histologic findings served as the reference standard. Diagnostic performance was compared using the McNemar test. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) between tumor and normal pituitary. Correlations between SUVmax and histopathologic or hormone characteristics were analyzed using the Spearman coefficient and logistic regression tests. Results A total of 43 participants (median age, 37 years [IQR, 31-49 years]; 35 female) were included, with 44 pituitary lesions identified after investigational imaging scans, 41 of which were confirmed as ACTH secreting. Sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of 68Ga-pentixafor PET/MRI were 92.7% (38 of 41 lesions; 95% CI: 80.6, 97.5) and 88.6% (39 of 44 lesions; 95% CI: 76.0, 95.0), respectively, which were higher compared with that of contrast-enhanced MRI (78.0% [32 of 41 lesions; 95% CI: 63.3, 88.0] and 77.3% [34 of 44 lesions; 95% CI: 63.0, 87.2], respectively). Both techniques combined improved sensitivity to 100% (41 of 41 lesions; 95% CI: 91.4, 100.0) and accuracy to 95.5% (42 of 44 lesions; 95% CI: 84.9, 99.2) (P = .01). ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors exhibited a higher SUVmax than normal pituitary (3.9 vs 1.3, P < .001). The SUVmax exhibited a positive correlation with CXCR4 H-score (R = 0.5 [95% CI: 0.2, 0.7], P < .001) and ACTH levels (R = 0.4 [95% CI: 0.1, 0.6], P = .01). Conclusion 68Ga-pentixafor PET/MRI demonstrated high sensitivity in localizing ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors. 68Ga-pentixafor uptake was associated with CXCR4 expression and ACTH level. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background The detection of in-stent restenosis (ISR) with coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is challenging, but CT perfusion (CTP) has demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy over CCTA in patients with stents. However, there are limited data on the performance of dynamic CTP, which allows noninvasive adjudication of regional myocardial blood flow. Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of regadenoson-stress dynamic CTP with that of CCTA, using fractional flow reserve (FFR) and the index of microvascular resistance (IMR) as reference standards for epicardial coronary circulation and coronary microcirculation, respectively. Materials and Methods Between January 2021 and June 2022, this prospective study enrolled patients with stents with indication for invasive coronary angiography due to suspicion of ISR or coronary artery disease progression. Participants underwent dynamic stress myocardial CTP and rest CTP plus CCTA. A wide coverage (z-axis coverage, 16 cm) and fast (gantry rotation time, 0.28 second) scanner was used. During invasive coronary angiography, FFR and IMR were obtained. The diagnostic rate (number of interpretable territories divided by number of evaluated territories) and accuracy of CCTA and CTP were evaluated in a territory-based analysis and compared with FFR and IMR (primary end points of the study). Results The study included 156 consecutive patients (136 men [87%]; mean age, 63.1 years ± 8.2 [SD]) with 504 stents. The diagnostic rate was higher for CTP than for CCTA (98.7% [789 of 799 territories] vs 95.6% [764 of 799 territories], P < .001). With use of FFR as the reference standard, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were higher for CTP than for CCTA (89.0%, 82.8%, and 84.7%, respectively, vs 60.0%, 61.9%, and 61.5%; P < .001). With use of IMR as the reference standard, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were higher with CTP than with CCTA (76.5%, 85.9%, and 82.9%, respectively, vs 48.2%, 63.5%, and 59.3%; P < .01). The mean effective dose of stress CTP plus CCTA was 10.4 mSv ± 2.7. Conclusion In patients with coronary stents, dynamic CTP improves the diagnostic performance of CCTA in the detection of territory-based ischemia. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Structural and functional MRI studies have revealed brain alterations associated with opioid use disorder (OUD). However, previous research has been limited by small sample sizes, few female participants, and single-modality analyses. Purpose To identify structural and functional brain alterations in individuals with OUD using whole-brain data-driven methods to analyze T1-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). Materials and Methods This secondary analysis of the Collaboration Linking Opioid Use Disorder and Sleep study compared participants with OUD (data collection February 2021 to February 2023) receiving methadone treatment with healthy control participants (data collection February 2018 to May 2023). T1-weighted MRI and rsfMRI were analyzed using tensor-based morphometry and intrinsic connectivity distribution, respectively. Primary outcome measures included regional brain volumes and functional connectivity. Voxel-wise linear regression was used to assess group differences, with family-wise error correction. Pearson partial correlations were used to examine structure-function relationships. Results Compared with healthy control participants (n = 105; median age, 27 years [IQR, 23-37 years]; 58 female), participants with OUD (n = 103; median age, 37 years [IQR, 31.5-46 years]; 62 male) showed smaller volumes (corrected P < .05) in the thalamus (β = -17.42 [95% CI: -26.56, -8.27]) and right medial temporal lobe (β = -8.02 [95% CI: -12.25, -3.78]). Larger volumes (corrected P < .05) were seen in the brainstem (pons and medulla, β = 15.21 [95% CI: 7.03, 23.40]; midbrain, β = 13.04 [95% CI: 6.61, 19.47]) and cerebellum (right, β = 14.96 [95% CI: 7.25, 22.67]; left, β = 14.88 [95% CI: 7.32, 22.43]). An interaction between sex and group was found for medial prefrontal cortex volume (β = -19.38, corrected P < .05), with female participants having smaller volumes than male participants in the OUD group. Increased functional connectivity (corrected P < .05) was noted in the thalamus (β = 0.50 [95% CI: 0.25, 0.75]), right medial temporal lobe (β = 0.43 [95% CI: 0.21, 0.66]), right cerebellum (β = 0.46 [95% CI: 0.21, 0.71]), and brainstem (β = 0.48 [95% CI: 0.22, 0.74]) in the OUD group. Structure and function were positively correlated in the cerebellum (Pearson r = 0.32 [95% CI: 0.17, 0.44], P < .001) and brainstem (Pearson r = 0.23 [95% CI: 0.09, 0.37], P = .002). Conclusion Individuals with OUD showed overlapping structural and functional brain alterations in opioid receptor-dense regions compared with healthy control participants. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Application of multimodal large language models (LLMs) with both textual and visual capabilities has been steadily increasing, but their ability to interpret radiologic images is still doubted. Purpose To evaluate the accuracy of LLMs and compare it with that of human readers with varying levels of experience and to assess the factors affecting LLM accuracy in answering New England Journal of Medicine Image Challenge cases. Materials and Methods Radiologic images of cases from October 13, 2005, to April 18, 2024, were retrospectively reviewed. Using text and image inputs, LLMs (Open AI's GPT-4 Turbo with Vision [GPT-4V] and GPT-4 Omni [GPT-4o], Google's DeepMind Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic's Claude 3) provided answers. Human readers (seven junior faculty radiologists, two clinicians, one in-training radiologist, and one medical student), blinded to the published answers, also answered. LLM accuracy with and without image inputs and short (cases from 2005 to 2015) versus long text inputs (from 2016 to 2024) was evaluated in subgroup analysis to determine the effect of these factors. Factor analysis was assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Accuracy was compared with generalized estimating equations, with multiple comparisons adjusted by using Bonferroni correction. Results A total of 272 cases were included. GPT-4o achieved the highest overall accuracy among LLMs (59.6%; 162 of 272), outperforming a medical student (47.1%; 128 of 272; P < .001) but not junior faculty (80.9%; 220 of 272; P < .001) or the in-training radiologist (70.2%; 191 of 272; P = .003). GPT-4o exhibited similar accuracy regardless of image inputs (without images vs with images, 54.0% [147 of 272] vs 59.6% [162 of 272], respectively; P = .59). Human reader accuracy was unaffected by text length, whereas LLMs demonstrated higher accuracy with long text inputs (all P < .001). Text input length affected LLM accuracy (odds ratio range, 3.2 [95% CI: 1.9, 5.5] to 6.6 [95% CI: 3.7, 12.0]). Conclusion LLMs demonstrated substantial accuracy with text and image inputs, outperforming a medical student. However, their accuracy decreased with shorter text lengths, regardless of image input. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

Purpose To determine the prognostic value of CT-QFR in predicting the long-term outcomes of patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) in comparison with invasive coronary angiography (ICA)/SPECT and to determine the influence of prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on the prognostic value of CT-QFR. Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of the prospective international CORE320 study, 379 participants who underwent coronary CTA and SPECT within 60 days before ICA between November 2009 and July 2011 were included for follow-up. The coronary CTA images were analyzed to determine CT-QFR. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in the 5-year follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves, multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for clinical variables, and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were used to assess and compare the predictive ability of CT-QFR and ICA/SPECT. Results CT-QFR computation and 5-year follow-up data were available for 310 participants (median age, 62 years), of whom 205 (66%) were male. CT-QFR (hazard ratio, 1.9 [95% CI: 1.0, 3.5]; P = .04) and prior myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 2.5 [95% CI: 1.5, 4.0]; P < .001) were independent predictors of MACE occurrence in the 5-year follow-up. MACE-free survival rates were similar in participants with normal CT-QFR and ICA/SPECT (82% vs 80%; P = .45) and in participants with abnormal CT-QFR and ICA/SPECT findings (60% vs 57%; P = .40). In participants with prior PCI, CT-QFR had a lower AUC in predicting MACEs than in participants without prior PCI (0.44 vs 0.70; P < .001). Conclusion CT-QFR was an independent predictor of MACEs in the 5-year follow-up in participants with suspected CAD and showed similar 5-year prognostic value to ICA/SPECT; however, prior PCI affected CT-QFR ability to predict MACEs.

    "abstract": "Background The incidence of distant-stage (metastatic) breast cancer at initial presentation has increased significantly in U.S. women under 40 years of age, but no clear trend in older women has been reported. Purpose To investigate trends in distant-stage breast cancer incidence using the latest available Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, including the COVID-19 pandemic years 2020 and 2021. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study of 71 million to 80 million women annually, SEER 22 stage-specific breast cancer incidence rates from January 2004 to December 2021 were analyzed using Joinpoint software to evaluate trends in distant-stage disease in U.S. women overall, by age group, and by race and ethnicity. Results Distant-stage breast cancer incidence rates at presentation increased significantly for U.S. women overall, with an annual percentage change (APC) of 1.16% (95% CI: 0.92, 1.42; P < .001) over 2004-2021. Distant-stage disease increased consistently for women aged 20-39 years (APC, 2.91%; P < .001) and for women aged 75 years or older (APC, 1.44%; P < .001). For women aged 40-74 years, the distant-stage breast cancer incidence rate increased with an APC of 2.10% over 2004-2010 (P = .002) and an APC of 2.73% over 2018-2021 (P = 0.01). The interruption of care in 2020 due to COVID-19 affected distant-stage breast cancer detection, especially for older women from racial and ethnic minority groups. The incidence of distant-stage breast cancer increased over 2004-2021 for Asian women (APC, 2.90%; P < .001), Black women (0.86%; P = .008), and Hispanic women (1.56%; P < .001) and over 2004-2019 for Native American women (3.86%; P = .04). White women showed an increase over 2004-2012 (1.68%; P = .01) but no evidence of a trend over 2012-2021. Distant-stage cancer incidence rates were 55% higher in Black women than White women. Conclusion Distant-stage breast cancer incidence rates at presentation have increased significantly in U.S. women overall; in age groups 20-39 years, 40-74 years, and 75 years or older; and in Asian, Black, Hispanic, and Native American women. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "The QIBA Profile for Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Assessing Gliomas.",
    "abstract": "The dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI measures of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) play a central role in monitoring therapeutic response and disease progression in patients with gliomas. Previous investigations have demonstrated promise of using rCBV in classifying tumor grade, elucidating tumor viability after therapy, and differentiating pseudoprogression and pseudoresponse. However, the quantification and reproducibility of rCBV measurements across patients, devices, and software remain a critical barrier to routine or clinical trial use of longitudinal DSC MRI in patients with gliomas. To address this limitation, the RSNA DSC MRI Biomarker Committee of the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance developed a Profile that defines statistics-based claims for the precision of longitudinal measurements. Although rCBV is the clinical marker of interest, the Profile focused on the reproducibility of the measured quantitative imaging biomarker, which is the area under the contrast agent concentration-time curve (AUC) normalized by the mean value of normal-appearing contralateral white matter tissue (tissue-normalized AUC values). Based on previous reports of within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV) in the tissue-normalized AUC values for enhancing gliomas (wCV = 0.31), an increase of 182% or more with respect to the baseline tissue-normalized AUC value indicates that an increase has occurred with 95% confidence. In contrast, a decrease of 64% or more with respect to baseline suggests that a decrease has occurred with 95% confidence. Similarly, an increase of 399% or more in the tissue-normalized AUC values in normal brain gray matter tissue (wCV = 0.40) suggests that an increase has occurred with 95% confidence, whereas a decrease of 80% or more with respect to baseline suggests that a decrease has occurred with 95% confidence. This article provides the rationale for these claims and the compliance activities needed to achieve these claims. Potential updates to incorporate new data based on advances in technology and clinical care in the Profile are also discussed.",

    "title": "Low-Dose CT Screening in East Asian Women Who Have Never Smoked: Association between Family History of Lung Cancer and Ground-Glass Nodule Prevalence and Growth.",
    "abstract": "Background Characteristics of ground-glass nodules (GGNs) in Asian women who have never smoked with family history of lung cancer (FHLC) remain unexamined. Purpose To investigate the differences in GGN progression to lung cancer at low-dose CT (LDCT) screening between Asian women who have never smoked with and without FHLC, and to examine associations between FHLC and GGN prevalence and growth. Materials and Methods This single-center retrospective study included East Asian women who had never smoked and had no personal history of lung cancer who underwent baseline LDCT for a health checkup between January 2011 and December 2015. Radiologists reviewed GGNs at baseline and follow-up, using Fleischner Society guidelines. Prevalence of persistent, multiple, and growing GGNs and incidence of pathology-confirmed lung cancer were compared in patients with and without FHLC. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to explore associations between FHLC and GGN prevalence and growth, adjusting for total size and solid proportion of baseline GGNs. Results Of 10 151 patients (mean age, 54 years ± 10 [SD]), 694 (6.8%) reported FHLC and 9457 (93.2%) did not. Among all patients, 515 (5.1%) had persistent GGNs (median follow-up period, 2551 days [IQR, 1104-3458 days]), 199 (2.0%) had multiple GGNs, 49 (0.5%) experienced GGN growth, and 31 (0.3%) were diagnosed with lung cancer. Patients with FHLC had a higher prevalence of persistent GGNs (8.2% [57 of 694] vs 4.8% [458 of 9457]; P < .001), multiple GGNs (3.7% [26 of 694] vs 1.8% [173 of 9457]; P < .001), and growing GGNs (1.3% [nine of 694] vs 0.4% [40 of 9457]; P = .001) and higher lung cancer incidence (0.9% [six of 694] vs 0.3% [25 of 9457]; P = .006). In multivariable analysis, FHLC was associated with increased prevalence of persistent GGNs (odds ratio [OR], 1.69 [95% CI: 1.26, 2.26]; P < .001) and multiple GGNs (OR, 2.02 [95% CI: 1.32, 3.08]; P = .001). FHLC was an independent risk factor for GGN growth over a 10-year period (hazard ratio, 2.14 [95% CI: 1.03, 4.44]; P = .04) after adjustments. Conclusion In East Asian women who had never smoked and who underwent LDCT screening, FHLC was associated with an increased prevalence of persistent and multiple GGNs, including proven adenocarcinomas, and was an independent risk factor for GGN growth over a 10-year period. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Large language models have already demonstrated potential in medical text processing. GPT-4V, a large vision-language model from OpenAI, has shown potential for medical imaging, yet a quantitative analysis is lacking. Purpose To quantitatively assess the performance of GPT-4V in interpreting radiologic images using unseen data. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included single representative abnormal and healthy control images from neuroradiology, cardiothoracic radiology, and musculoskeletal radiology (CT, MRI, radiography) to generate reports using GPT-4V via the application programming interface from February to March 2024. The factual correctness of free-text reports and the performance in detecting abnormalities in binary classification tasks were assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The binary classification performance was compared with that of a first-year nonradiologist in training and four board-certified radiologists. Results A total of 515 images in 470 patients (median age, 61 years [IQR, 44-71 years]; 267 male) were included, of which 345 images were abnormal. GPT-4V correctly identified the imaging modality and anatomic region in 100% (515 of 515) and 99.2% (511 of 515) of images, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy in free-text reports was between 0% (0 of 33 images) for pneumothorax (CT and radiography) and 90% (45 of 50 images) for brain tumor (MRI). In binary classification tasks, GPT-4V showed sensitivities between 56% (14 of 25 images) for ischemic stroke and 100% (25 of 25 images) for brain hemorrhage and specificities between 8% (two of 25 images) for brain hemorrhage and 52% (13 of 25 images) for pneumothorax, compared with a pooled sensitivity of 97.2% (1103 of 1135 images) and pooled specificity of 97.2% (1084 of 1115 images) for the human readers across all tasks. The model exhibited a clear tendency to overdiagnose abnormalities, with 86.5% (147 of 170 images) and 67.7% (151 of 223 images) false-positive rates for the free-text and binary classification tasks, respectively. Conclusion GPT-4V, in its earliest version, recognized medical image content and reliably determined the modality and anatomic region from single images. However, GPT-4V failed to detect, classify, or rule out abnormalities in image interpretation. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

The patient had also been diagnosed with 72% stenosis of the left carotid artery, although it was asymptomatic and thus endarterectomy was not required. The medical history included arterial hypertension and an incomplete left bundle branch block. CTA was performed according to standard procedure, with the region of interest to initiate the examination being placed within the aortic arch and contrast material injected at 5 mL/sec via a catheter placed in the left antecubital fossa. The catheter was successfully tested, and the contrast material was subsequently injected without incident, with the patient reporting no pain and the automatic pressure sensor showing no anomalies. The scan was automatically launched because the attenuation within the aortic arch reached 800 HU (Figs 1-3).",

    "abstract": "Background Digital subtraction angiography and thrill palpation demonstrate limitations when used to assess the outcomes of angioplasty in autologous arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Purpose To investigate a new functional quantifiable index of successful angioplasty for failing AVFs using intraprocedural percutaneous US volume flow (VF) measurements. Materials and Methods This prospective, multicenter, single-arm, cohort clinical trial included consecutive patients with indications for fluoroscopically guided balloon angioplasty due to AVF dysfunction between June 2020 and May 2022. Intraprocedural VF measurements were obtained before the procedure and after balloon dilation using transcutaneous duplex US. The primary end points were the quantification of VF-guided angioplasty outcomes and assessment of the association between postprocedural VF and freedom from target lesion reintervention (TLR) due to recurrence of access failure. Cox multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of TLR-free survival, which was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the optimal cutoff VF value. Results In total, 100 participants (mean age, 67 years ± 12 [SD]; 84 male) were evaluated. The rate of freedom from TLR was 73% at 6 months. The mean pre- and postintervention VF values were 353 mL/min ± 199 and 1045 mL/min ± 413, respectively. Higher VF at completion of angioplasty (hazard ratio, 0.89 per 100 mL/min [95% CI: 0.82, 0.98]; P = .01) and forearm versus upper arm AVF (hazard ratio, 0.51 [95% CI: 0.27, 0.95]; P = .03) were independent predictors of increased freedom from TLR. A postprocedural VF of 720 mL/min (P < .001) was identified as the optimal cutoff point for predicting increased fistula freedom from reintervention and freedom of restenosis for radiocephalic AVFs, compared with an optimal cutoff point of 1120 mL/min (P = .03) for upper arm AVFs. Conclusion Intraprocedural VF measurement is a quantifiable functional index and postprocedural predictor of outcomes following angioplasty for failing dialysis AVFs.

    "abstract": "Background Climate change, driven primarily by human-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, poses major risks to human health. Health care contributes 8.5% of GHG emissions in the United States. Purpose To estimate the life cycle environmental impact of diagnostic radiology services within a single academic medical center. Materials and Methods This process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) of a diagnostic radiology department serving adult inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department patients in a U.S. hospital followed International Organization for Standardization (ISO 14040:2006) guidelines. System components included production and distribution of imaging equipment; energy use of imaging equipment, including MRI, CT, radiography and fluoroscopy, and US; production and use of other capital equipment; production of single-use, semidurable, and durable supplies and linens; and production and energy use from onsite data storage. Meters monitored the power usage of selected imaging equipment during April 2023. Modeling assumed an equipment lifespan of 10 years. Results are reported in kilotons of CO2 equivalent (kt CO2e) emissions per scan and over a 10-year period. A sensitivity analysis assessed variability of data. Results Over a decade, these radiology services generated 4.6 kt CO2e GHG emissions, with MRI responsible for 48% (2.2 of 4.6 kt CO2e) and CT responsible for 24% (1.1 of 4.6 kt CO2e) of cumulative emissions. Clinical use of imaging equipment (all modalities) accounted for 54% of departmental GHGs (2.5 of 4.6 kt CO2e). Other notable contributions include the production of imaging equipment (11%, 0.49 of 4.6 kt CO2e), the production and use of picture archiving and communication system workstations (11%, 0.48 of 4.6 kt CO2e), and linens production and laundering (10%, 0.47 of 4.6 kt CO2e). Conclusion Energy consumption from clinical use of imaging equipment accounted for more than 50% of departmental GHG emissions, with MRI and CT equipment as the major emitters. Other notable GHG contributors include the production of imaging equipment, the production and use of picture archiving and communication system workstations, and linens production and laundering. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Tumor fraction (TF) at liquid biopsy is a potential noninvasive marker for tumor burden, but validation is needed. Purpose To evaluate TF as a potential surrogate for tumor burden, assessed at contrast-enhanced CT across diverse metastatic cancers. Methods This retrospective monocentric study included patients with cancer and metastatic disease, with TF results and contemporaneous contrast-enhanced CT performed between January 2021 and January 2023. The total tumor volume (TTV), representing CT tumor burden, was calculated by adding all lesion volumes and was computed by using manually outlined annotations of each lesion on the largest surface of the axial slice. TF greater than 10% was considered high. A training-validation split was applied. Correlations between TF and TTV were assessed using regression models and Spearman correlation coefficients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis established the TTV cutoff. The metastatic site, histology type, and TTV were used to predict liquid biopsy contributory status. Results Among 1065 patients (median age, 62 years [IQR: 53, 70]; 537 female), 56 288 lesions were annotated, mostly in the lung (n = 20 334), lymph nodes (n = 11 651), and liver (n = 10 277). A total of 763 liquid biopsies were contributive, 254 were noncontributive, and 48 failed. The training and validation sets included 745 and 320 patients, respectively. TF helped predict TTV with the linear model (R2 = 0.17; ρ = 0.41; P < .001). The TTV and TF categories achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.78), with an optimal cutoff of 151 cm3 for TTV and a TF cutoff of 10%. The sensitivity was 57% (204 of 359) and the specificity was 80% (525 of 658). TTV helped predict contributory status, with an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.76) and an optimal cutoff greater than 37 cm3. Liver lesion volumes were significantly associated with a contributory liquid biopsy in the validation cohort. Conclusion While correlated, TF at liquid biopsy did not accurately represent the TTV at CT. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "A 43-year-old male patient with no known past medical history presented to the emergency department with new-onset bitemporal headache, dizziness, and bilateral lower extremity weakness for 1 day. The patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, or recent exposure to sick individuals. He was not on any medications and denied alcohol or illicit drug use. Vital signs were unremarkable. Physical examination was notable for a left-sided pronator drift and bilateral dysmetria that was more pronounced on the left. Results of routine laboratory workup, including complete blood count, metabolic panel, and high-sensitivity troponin level, were normal. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, T-wave inversions in the inferior leads, left axis deviation, incomplete right bundle branch block, and frequent premature ventricular contractions. A radiograph of the chest was unremarkable. CT of the head without contrast enhancement demonstrated no acute intracranial abnormalities. MRI of the brain without contrast enhancement revealed multiple acute infarcts involving left posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution, right cerebellar hemisphere, right mesial temporal lobe, and right posterior limb of the internal capsule. CT angiography of the head and neck showed an occlusion of the right posterior cerebral artery near its origin, with a trace of distal flow. Given that these findings were concerning for a cardioembolic etiology of acute ischemic stroke, transesophageal echocardiography was performed. This showed mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40%, mild global hypokinesis, and an additional finding also seen at subsequent cardiac CT and MRI, disclosed herein. The patient was started on systemic anticoagulation and guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. CT of the chest showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy or abnormalities in the lung parenchyma or interstitium. Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) was performed, followed by cardiac MRI.",

    "title": "PiSlope: A New CT Metric for Quantifying Airway Remodeling in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.",
    "abstract": "Background Airway wall thickening is commonly quantified at chest CT with Pi10, the square root of the wall area of a hypothetical airway with a luminal perimeter of 10 mm. Although Pi10 has proven to be a useful construct, it assumes uniform thickening of all airways and considers only a single airway level in summarizing airway remodeling, limiting its accuracy. Purpose To evaluate PiSlope, a new metric for the quantification of airway wall thickening. Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of data from a multicenter prospective study of individuals who currently smoke or formerly smoked as well as healthy volunteers who never smoked enrolled from January 2008 to June 2011 and followed up longitudinally until September 2022, chest CT images were analyzed section by section to quantify the luminal perimeter and airway wall thickness for each visible airway. Linear regression was used to calculate the slope of the luminal perimeter against wall thickness to determine the PiSlope. PiSlope was normalized by the individual's height squared. Multivariable regression was used to test the associations between airway metrics and respiratory outcomes. Results The mean age of the 8199 participants was 59.5 years ± 9.1 (SD), with 53% male and 67% White participants. With increasing disease severity (ie, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stages 0-4), Pi10 increased (4.26 mm ± 0.23, 4.29 mm ± 0.21, 4.43 mm ± 0.26, 4.51 mm ± 0.28, and 4.53 mm ± 0.27, respectively) and PiSlope decreased (0.38 ± 0.10, 0.38 ± 0.10, 0.35 ± 0.11, 0.33 ± 0.10, and 0.31 ± 0.10) (trend test; both P < .001). Multivariable analyses revealed that PiSlope was associated with dyspnea, respiratory quality of life, 6-minute walk distance, exacerbations, lung function decline, and all-cause mortality, with and without Pi10 being included in the model. Conclusion The new metric PiSlope quantifies airway wall remodeling and shows associations with respiratory symptoms, quality of life, exacerbations, lung function decline, and all-cause mortality.

    "title": "Interstitial Lung Abnormalities on Unselected Abdominal and Thoracoabdominal CT Scans in 21 118 Patients.",
    "abstract": "Background Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) are incidental CT findings suggesting early interstitial lung disease. However ILA prevalence data are scarce in an unselected routine clinical setting. Purpose To evaluate the prevalence, underreporting rate, and potential clinical impact of ILAs recognizable on either abdominal CT scans or thoracoabdominal CT scans in a routine clinical setting of unselected patients. Materials and Methods Consecutive abdominal or thoracoabdominal CT scans from unselected inpatients and outpatients (age, ≥50 years; without any available prior chest CT and no clinical history of disease against the diagnosis of ILA) from a single-center tertiary hospital between January 2008 and December 2015 were retrospectively reviewed for the presence of ILAs and compared with the original clinical reports from the CT scans. Radiologic progression of ILA was evaluated by comparing consecutive CT points. Multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, oncologic disease, and cardiovascular disease were used to assess factors associated with odds of ILAs progression and all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Results Among 21 118 patients (median age, 72 years [IQR, 64-80 years]; 11 028 [52.2%] female patients), ILAs were observed in 362 (1.7%) patients, notably in 222 (1.0%) patients who had fibrotic features at CT. ILAs were recognized in 122 of 9415 (1.3%) and 240 of 11 703 (2.1%) of abdominal and thoracoabdominal CT scans, respectively. Of available original reports for 360 patients, 158 (43.9%) of all ILAs were not originally reported. Traction bronchiectasis index was the CT factor associated with higher odds of ILA progression (odds ratio, 3.47; 95% CI: 1.83, 6.58; P < .001). Fibrotic ILAs had a fourfold higher risk of respiratory-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 4.01; 95% CI: 2.02, 7.92; P < .001) compared with patients without ILAs. Conclusion The prevalence of ILAs was 1.7% in a large, unselected sample of patients who underwent either abdominal or thoracoabdominal CT for various clinical indications. Despite their prognostic significance, 43.9% of ILAs were unreported. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article. See also the editorial by Hata in this issue.",

    "title": "Care to Explain? AI Explanation Types Differentially Impact Chest Radiograph Diagnostic Performance and Physician Trust in AI.",
    "abstract": "Background It is unclear whether artificial intelligence (AI) explanations help or hurt radiologists and other physicians in AI-assisted radiologic diagnostic decision-making. Purpose To test whether the type of AI explanation and the correctness and confidence level of AI advice impact physician diagnostic performance, perception of AI advice usefulness, and trust in AI advice for chest radiograph diagnosis. Materials and Methods A multicenter, prospective randomized study was conducted from April 2022 to September 2022. Two types of AI explanations prevalent in medical imaging-local (feature-based) explanations and global (prototype-based) explanations-were a between-participant factor, while AI correctness and confidence were within-participant factors. Radiologists (task experts) and internal or emergency medicine physicians (task nonexperts) received a chest radiograph to read; then, simulated AI advice was presented. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze the effects of the experimental variables on diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, physician perception of AI usefulness, and \"simple trust\" (ie, speed of alignment with or divergence from AI advice); the control variables included knowledge of AI, demographic characteristics, and task expertise. Holm-Sidak corrections were used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Results Data from 220 physicians (median age, 30 years [IQR, 28-32.75 years]; 146 male participants) were analyzed. Compared with global AI explanations, local AI explanations yielded better physician diagnostic accuracy when the AI advice was correct (β = 0.86; P value adjusted for multiple comparisons [Padj] < .001) and increased diagnostic efficiency overall by reducing the time spent considering AI advice (β = -0.19; Padj = .01). While there were interaction effects of explanation type, AI confidence level, and physician task expertise on diagnostic accuracy (β = -1.05; Padj = .04), there was no evidence that AI explanation type or AI confidence level significantly affected subjective measures (physician diagnostic confidence and perception of AI usefulness). Finally, radiologists and nonradiologists placed greater simple trust in local AI explanations than in global explanations, regardless of the correctness of the AI advice (β = 1.32; Padj = .048). Conclusion The type of AI explanation impacted physician diagnostic performance and trust in AI, even when physicians themselves were not aware of such effects. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background Climate change adversely affects human health, resulting in higher demand for health care services. However, the impact of climate-related environmental exposures on medical imaging utilization is currently unknown. Purpose To determine associations of short-term exposures to ambient heat and particulate air pollution with utilization of emergency department medical imaging. Materials and Methods In this retrospective time-stratified case-crossover study, daily imaging utilization counts from four emergency departments were linked to local daily environmental data-including fine particulate matter with 2.5-µm or smaller aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and ambient temperature-over 10 years (January 2013 to December 2022). Conditional Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the associations between daily imaging utilization and environmental exposures on the same day and each of the 7 days preceding imaging, lag days 0-7, controlling for day of the week, month, and year. Moving averages of mean daily PM2.5 and temperature were calculated to account for lagged exposure effects. Imaging counts were also stratified by modality (CT, radiography, US, and MRI). Results In an analysis of 1 666 420 emergency department imaging studies, a rise of 10 °C in the 2-day moving average of mean daily temperature and a rise of 10 μg/m3 in the 3-day moving average of mean daily PM2.5 were associated with overall imaging utilization increases of 5.1% (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.051; 95% CI: 1.045, 1.056) and 4.0% (IRR, 1.040; 95% CI: 1.035, 1.046), respectively. Heat exposure days (mean temperature >20 °C) and air pollution exposure days (mean PM2.5 >12 μg/m3) were associated with same-day excess absolute risk of 5.5 and 6.4 imaging studies per 1 million people at risk per day, respectively. Heat exposure days and air pollution exposure days were associated with increased utilization of radiography (excess relative risk, 2.7% [P < .001] and 2.1% [P < .001], respectively) and CT (excess relative risk, 2.0% [P = .001] and 2.7% [P < .001]) but not US (P = .14 and P = .14) or MRI (P = .70 and P = .65). Conclusion Short-term exposures to ambient heat and particulate air pollution were associated with increased utilization of radiography and CT but not US or MRI. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Deep learning (DL) algorithms have shown promising results in mammographic screening either compared to a single reader or, when deployed in conjunction with a human reader, compared with double reading. Purpose To externally validate the performance of three DL algorithms as mammographic screen readers in an independent UK data set. Materials and Methods Three commercial DL algorithms (DL-1, DL-2, and DL-3) were retrospectively investigated from January 2022 to June 2022 using consecutive full-field digital mammograms collected at two UK sites during 1 year (2017). Normal cases with 3-year follow-up and histopathologically proven cancer cases detected either at screening (that round or next) or within the 3-year interval were included. A preset specificity threshold equivalent to a single reader was applied. Performance was evaluated for stand-alone DL reading compared with single human reading, and for DL reading combined with human reading compared with double reading, using sensitivity and specificity as the primary metrics. P < .025 was considered to indicate statistical significance for noninferiority testing. Results A total of 26 722 cases (median patient age, 59.0 years [IQR, 54.0-63.0 years]) with mammograms acquired using machines from two vendors were included. Cases included 332 screen-detected, 174 interval, and 254 next-round cancers. Two of three stand-alone DL algorithms achieved noninferior sensitivity (DL-1: 64.8%, P < .001; DL-2: 56.7%, P = .03; DL-3: 58.9%, P < .001) compared with the single first reader (62.8%), and specificity was noninferior for DL-1 (92.8%; P < .001) and DL-2 (96.8%; P < .001) and superior for DL-3 (97.9%; P < .001) compared with the single first reader (96.5%). Combining the DL algorithms with human readers achieved noninferior sensitivity (67.0%, 65.6%, and 65.4% for DL-1, DL-2, and DL-3, respectively; P < .001 for all) compared with double reading (67.4%), and superior specificity (97.4%, 97.6%, and 97.6%; P < .001 for all) compared with double reading (97.1%). Conclusion Use of stand-alone DL algorithms in combination with a human reader could maintain screening accuracy while reducing workload. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

    "abstract": "Background Synaptic loss is an important factor in Alzheimer disease (AD); however, blood assays that conveniently and rapidly reflect changes in synaptic density are lacking. Purpose To correlate multiple potential synaptic blood markers with synaptic density measured using 18F-SynVesT-1, a fluorine 18 (18F)-labeled radiotracer, brain PET and to explore the independent associations between these markers and synaptic density. Materials and Methods This prospective study included 50 cognitively unimpaired (mean age, 65.0 years ± 8.3 [SD]; 37 female) participants and 70 participants with cognitive impairment (mean age, 69.5 years ± 7.9; 43 female) from the Memory Clinic of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Ruijin Hospital and communities in Shanghai. Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau were assessed using 18F-florbetapir and 18F-MK6240 PET/CT. Synaptic density was evaluated with 18F-SynVesT-1 PET/MRI. Pearson correlation analysis was used to investigate relationships of plasma (Aβ42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau 181 [p-tau-181], glial fibrillary acid protein [GFAP], neurofilament light) and serum (C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-α, α-synuclein, neurogranin, active plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, tissue plasminogen activator) biomarkers with synaptic density. Linear regression models and mediation analysis were used to explore effects of other AD-related pathologies on these relationships. Results Correlations were observed between increased p-tau-181 and GFAP and decreased synaptic density in global cortex (rp-tau-181 = -0.352, rGFAP = -0.386; both P < .001) and hippocampus (rp-tau-181 = -0.361, rGFAP = -0.369; both P < .001) at 18F-SynVesT-1 PET/MRI. The relationships between p-tau-181 and GFAP with 18F-SynVesT-1 PET/MRI persisted after controlling for plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, Aβ PET, or cortical thickness (P value range, <.001-.01). This association disappeared after controlling for tau PET (P value range, .08-.83). Conclusion Plasma p-tau-181 and GFAP are closely associated with synaptic density measured using 18F-SynVesT-1 PET/MRI, with the relationship primarily influenced by tau accumulation rather than Aβ deposition or cortical thickness. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Because of its ability to help assess the presence of subtle morphologic changes in bone and bone marrow edema, dual-energy CT (DECT) could be an alternative to MRI in the diagnosis of bone stress injury that includes a stress fracture (SF) and stress reaction (SR). Purpose To determine the diagnostic accuracy of DECT in identifying bone stress injury of the lower limb using MRI as the reference standard. Materials and Methods This prospective study, conducted between June 2021 and January 2024, included consecutive patients clinically suspected of having stress injury (SF or SR) of the lower limb (leg, ankle, or foot). Imaging diagnosis was based on the absence or presence of cortical or periosteal changes, bone marrow edema, or a fracture line. The diagnostic performance of four blinded independent readers was determined for the entire cohort and for the subset of participants without fracture lines. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated. Interobserver agreement was evaluated with Kendall coefficient of concordance (W). Results A total of 184 patients (mean age, 58 years ± 17 [SD]; 97 male) were enrolled. At MRI, 107 of 184 participants (58%) had positive diagnoses, including 70 with SF and 37 with SR. The mean overall sensitivity and specificity were 91% (390 of 428; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.95) and 93% (287 of 308; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.97), respectively, with an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.97). Among patients without fracture lines (n = 114), the mean overall sensitivity and specificity of DECT were 79% (117 of 148; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.88) and 93% (287 of 308; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.97), respectively, with an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.94). The interobserver agreement was very good for diagnosis of SF and SR combined (Kendall W = 0.90) and SR alone (Kendall W = 0.84). Conclusion DECT helped to accurately diagnose bone stress injury of the lower limb by identifying fracture lines and osseous stress reactions. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) are often seropositive for antibodies against aquaporin-4 (AQP4). The importance of MRI monitoring in this disease requires evaluation. Purpose To profile MRI features from a large international cohort with AQP4 immunoglobulin G (IgG)-seropositive NMOSD (from the Parallel MRI in NMOSD [PAMRINO] study) and to evaluate and confirm existing knowledge regarding the incidence, location, and longitudinal development of characteristic lesions in the central nervous system associated with AQP4-IgG-seropositive NMOSD. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study (from August 2016 to January 2019), MRI and clinical data were collected from 17 NMOSD expert sites in 11 countries across four continents. Clinical features and lesions identified at cross-sectional and longitudinal MRI were assessed. No formal statistical tests were used to compare observations; however, means, SDs, and 95% CIs are reported when evaluating lesion frequencies. Results Available T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI scans in patients with AQP4-IgG-seropositive NMOSD (n = 525) were read. Among the 525 patients, 320 underwent cerebral MRI examinations with T2-weighted hyperintense cerebral (264 of 320; 82.5%), cerebellar (44 of 320; 13.8%), and brainstem (158 of 321 [49.2%], including one lesion observed at cervical spinal cord [SC] MRI) lesions. Lesions in the optic nerves, analyzed from 152 MRI examinations, were mainly found in the central (81 of 92; 88%) and posterior (79 of 92; 86%) sections (bilaterally in 39 of 92; 42%). Longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis was the predominant SC lesion pattern (upper compartment from 322 MRI examinations, 133 of 210 [63.3%]; and lower compartment from 301 MRI examinations, 149 of 212 [70.3%]). However, nonlongitudinal extensive transverse myelitis lesions were also observed frequently (105 of 210; 50.0%) in the cervical SC. Clinical data (n = 349; mean age, 44 years ± 14 [SD]; 202 female patients) and acute lesions at contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI (n = 58, performed within 30 days of the last attack) were evaluated. CE lesions were detected in the cerebrum (eight of 13; 62%), optic nerves (14 of 19; 74%), or chiasm (three of four; 75%) within 15 days of any relapse. In the upper SC (29 of 44; 66%), CE lesions were frequently observed up to 20 days after a clinical myelitis event. Conclusion A high incidence of abnormal brain MRI examinations and nonlongitudinal extensive SC lesions was found in patients in PAMRINO with AQP4-IgG-seropositive NMOSD. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "With the rising incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, there has been increasing use of local-regional therapy (LRT) to downstage or bridge to transplant, for definitive treatment, and for palliation. The CT/MRI Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) Treatment Response Assessment (TRA) algorithm provides guidance for step-by-step tumor assessment after LRT and standardized reporting. Current evidence suggests that the algorithm performs well in the assessment of tumor response to arterial embolic and loco-ablative therapies and fair when assessing response to radiation-based therapies, with limited data to validate the latter. Both evidence-based and expert-based refinements of the algorithm are needed to improve its diagnostic accuracy after varying types of LRT. This review provides an overview of the challenges and limitations of the LI-RADS TRA algorithm version 2017 and discusses the refinements introduced in the updated 2024 LI-RADS algorithm for CT/MRI.",

Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, unique itemized radiologic reports of bedside chest radiographs, associated demographic data, and laboratory markers of inflammation from patients in intensive care from January 2009 to December 2019 were evaluated. GPT-4 ADA, accessed between December 2023 and January 2024, was tasked with autonomously analyzing this dataset by plotting radiography usage rates, providing descriptive statistics measures, quantifying factors of pulmonary opacities, and setting up machine learning (ML) models to predict their presence. Three scientists with 6-10 years of ML experience validated the outputs by verifying the methodology, assessing coding quality, re-executing the provided code, and comparing ML models head-to-head with their human-developed counterparts (based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity). Statistical significance was evaluated using bootstrapping. Results A total of 43 788 radiograph reports, with their laboratory values, from University Hospital RWTH Aachen were evaluated from 43 788 patients (mean age, 66 years ± 15 [SD]; 26 804 male). While GPT-4 ADA provided largely appropriate visualizations, descriptive statistical measures, quantitative statistical associations based on logistic regression, and gradient boosting machines for the predictive task (AUC, 0.75), some statistical errors and inaccuracies were encountered. ML strategies were valid and based on consistent coding routines, resulting in valid outputs on par with human specialist-developed reference models (AUC, 0.80 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.81] vs 0.80 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.81]; P = .51) (accuracy, 79% [6910 of 8758 patients] vs 78% [6875 of 8758 patients], respectively; P = .27). Conclusion LLMs may facilitate data analysis in radiology, from basic statistics to advanced ML-based predictive modeling. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "title": "Changes in Reader Performance During Sequential Reading of Breast Cancer Screening Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Examinations.",
    "abstract": "Background Studies suggest that readers experience perceptual adaptation when interpreting batched screening mammograms, which may serve as a mechanism for improved performance. Purpose To analyze clinical digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening data to evaluate changes in reader performance during sequential batch reading. Materials and Methods This observational retrospective study used data from the radiology information system collected for screening DBT examinations performed from January 2018 to December 2019. The reference standard was established based on pathology results, if applicable, or imaging findings at 1-year follow-up. Examinations were aggregated into batches, defined as a sequence of cases for a given reader with differences in interexamination time of 10 minutes or less. Mixed-effect models were used to evaluate performance and timing across batch positions. Statistical adjustments accounted for potential confounders, including patient characteristics (age, breast density), reading factors (day of week, time of day), and between-reader heterogeneity. Results The dataset included 121 652 examinations (median patient age, 61 years [IQR, 53-69 years]), including 1081 cancers interpreted by 15 radiologists. Unadjusted false-positive rates decreased from an averaged 15.5% at the first within-batch examination to 10.5% after three sequentially read examinations (P < .001), without a significant change in sensitivity (82.6% vs 84.2%; P = .15). The interpretation time consistently decreased, achieving a substantial reduction in longer batches (average 2.8 to 2.2 minutes for noncancer examinations; P < .001). Adjustment for sampling bias and confounders (patient age, breast density, day of week, time of day; all P < .005) reduced the effect on false-positive rates (11.5% to 9.4% after three examinations; P < .001) and interpretation time (3.2 to 2.7 minutes for noncancer examinations; P < .001). Conclusion Radiologists showed improved recall rates and interpretation times without change in sensitivity over the course of batch reading of DBT screening examinations. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Iima and Satake in this issue.",

    "abstract": "Background Cardiac MRI at 5 T has recently become available and potentially improves tissue contrast enhancement at gadolinium chelate-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. Purpose To evaluate the feasibility of 5-T myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) MRI in assessing myocardial fibrosis by comparing image quality and LGE quantification with reference-standard 3-T myocardial LGE MRI. Materials and Methods Consecutive patients with confirmed myocardial fibrosis on previous 3-T MRI scans between January 2023 and July 2023 prospectively underwent follow-up imaging from August 2023 to November 2023. Each participant underwent follow-up 5-T imaging using an identical dose of contrast agent. Radiologist scoring of image quality using a Likert scale (range, 1-5), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), contrast ratio, and semiautomatic quantitative LGE assessment were obtained and reported as medians and IQRs. Paired Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare characteristics derived at 3-T and 5-T imaging. Results A total of 18 participants (mean age, 49 years ± 17 [SD]; nine male participants) were included, with a mean interval of 6.2 months ± 2.3 between undergoing 3-T and 5-T MRI. Median image quality scores were 4.0 (IQR, 3.0-4.2) at 3 T and 4.0 (IQR, 3.0-4.4) at 5 T (P = .45). SNR at 5 T was higher than at 3 T (183.7 [IQR, 147.2-255.9] vs 125.8 [IQR, 108.2-171.6], respectively; P = .002). Median CNR at 5 T was higher than at 3 T in normal myocardium (50.8 [IQR, 35.4-67.9] vs 16.5 [IQR, 11.3-24.6], respectively) and pericardial fat (21.4 [IQR, 7.1-29.3] vs -5.0 [IQR, -16.4 to -2.3], respectively) (both P < .001). There was no evidence of a difference in the percentage of LGE quantified between 5 T and 3 T (median, 11.8% [IQR, 7.7%-20.5%] vs 12.6% [IQR, 6.6%-20.4%], respectively; P = .81). Conclusion Myocardial LGE MRI at 5 T was found to be feasible, with no evidence of differences in subjective image quality and myocardial fibrosis quantification compared with 3-T myocardial LGE MRI. Furthermore, with use of identical contrast agent doses, SNRs and CNRs were improved at 5 T. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license. Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Diagnostic Accuracy of CT for the Detection of Hepatic Steatosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Background CT plays an important role in the opportunistic identification of hepatic steatosis. CT performance for steatosis detection has been inconsistent across various studies, and no clear guidelines on optimum thresholds have been established. Purpose To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess CT diagnostic accuracy in hepatic steatosis detection and to determine reliable cutoffs for the commonly mentioned measures in the literature. Materials and Methods A systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases (English-language studies published from September 1977 to January 2024) was performed. Studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of noncontrast CT (NCCT), contrast-enhanced (CECT), and dual-energy CT (DECT) for hepatic steatosis detection were included. Reference standards included biopsy, MRI proton density fat fraction (PDFF), or NCCT. In several CECT and DECT studies, NCCT was used as the reference standard, necessitating subgroup analysis. Statistical analysis included a random-effects meta-analysis, assessment of heterogeneity with use of the I2 statistic, and meta-regression to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. When available, mean liver attenuation, liver-spleen attenuation difference, liver to spleen attenuation ratio, and the DECT-derived fat fraction for hepatic steatosis diagnosis were assessed. Results Forty-two studies (14 186 participants) were included. NCCT had a sensitivity and specificity of 72% and 88%, respectively, for steatosis (>5% fat at biopsy) detection and 82% and 94% for at least moderate steatosis (over 20%-33% fat at biopsy) detection. CECT had a sensitivity and specificity of 66% and 90% for steatosis detection and 68% and 93% for at least moderate steatosis detection. DECT had a sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 88% for steatosis detection. In the subgroup analysis, the sensitivity and specificity for detecting steatosis were 80% and 99% for CECT and 84% and 93% for DECT. There was heterogeneity among studies focusing on CECT and DECT. Liver attenuation less than 40-45 HU, liver-spleen attenuation difference less than -5 to 0 HU, and liver to spleen attenuation ratio less than 0.9-1 achieved high specificity for detection of at least moderate steatosis. Conclusion NCCT showed high performance for detection of at least moderate steatosis. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background The clinicopathologic-radiologic and prognostic characteristics of intratumoral fat in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are critical for personalized treatment but remain understudied. Purpose To investigate the clinicopathologic-radiologic associations and prognostic implications of MRI-assessed intratumoral fat in HCCs. Materials and Methods This retrospective cohort study included consecutive adult patients who underwent resection for solitary HCCs and preoperative contrast-enhanced MRI from two tertiary-care hospitals in East Asia (March 2011 to December 2021) and Western Europe (September 2012 to December 2019). MRI scans were independently evaluated by three radiologists at each hospital. Based on Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) version 2018, intratumoral fat was defined as \"fat in mass more than adjacent liver,\" and the homogeneous subtype was defined as intratumoral fat \"in absence of mosaic and nodule-in-nodule architecture.\" Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with RFS and OS. Results A total of 933 patients were included in the Asian (n = 736; median age, 53 years [IQR, 45-62 years]; 626 male) and European (n = 207; median age, 64 years [IQR, 55-70 years]; 161 male) cohorts. MRI-assessed intratumoral fat was detected in 30% (215 of 726) and 31% (64 of 207) of patients in the Asian and European cohorts, respectively (P = .72). In both cohorts, the steatohepatitic subtype, nonperipheral washout, enhancing capsule, and mosaic architecture were more frequent in tumors with intratumoral fat (P value range, <.001 to .04). Intratumoral fat in general was not associated with RFS or OS in either cohort (P value range, .48-.97). However, in the Asian cohort, homogeneous intratumoral fat was associated with longer RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; P = .009) and OS (HR, 0.33; P = .008) in multivariable Cox regression analyses. Conclusion MRI-assessed intratumoral fat was more frequent in steatohepatitic HCCs and associated with nonperipheral washout, enhancing capsule, and mosaic architecture. Although intratumoral fat was generally nonprognostic, homogeneous intratumoral fat was associated with longer RFS and OS in the Asian cohort. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

    "abstract": "Background Percutaneous CT-guided lung core-needle biopsy is a frequently performed and generally safe procedure. However, with advances in the management of lung cancer, there is a need for a greater amount of tissue for tumor genomic profiling and characterization. Purpose To determine whether the number of core samples obtained with percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsy is associated with postprocedural complications. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous CT-guided coaxial lung core-needle biopsy for suspected primary lung cancer between November 2012 and August 2023 at an academic tertiary referral hospital. Patient data from medical records were collected, including demographics, lesion size and distance from pleura, and number of obtained biopsy samples. Postprocedural complications of pneumothorax, chest tube placement, perilesional hemorrhage, and hemoptysis were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess whether the number of cores was a predictive factor for lung biopsy complications. Results A total of 827 patients (mean age, 70.9 years ± 9.6 [SD]; 474 [57.3%] female patients) were included. The median lesion size was 22 mm (IQR, 15-34 mm), with 517 of 827 (62.5%) patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. Pneumothorax was noted in 171 of 827 (20.7%) patients, with a chest tube placed in 32 of 827 (3.9%), perilesional hemorrhage in 353 of 827 (42.7%), and hemoptysis in 20 of 827 (2.4%) patients. The median number of samples obtained was four (range, one to 12). Multivariable analysis showed no evidence of an association between the number of core samples obtained and any complications: pneumothorax (coefficient, -0.02; P = .81), chest tube (coefficient, 0.18; P = .26), perilesional hemorrhage (coefficient, -0.03; P = .63), or hemoptysis (coefficient, -0.10; P = .60). Conclusion In patients suspected of having lung cancer who underwent percutaneous CT-guided coaxial lung core biopsy, there was no evidence of an association between the number of core biopsy samples obtained and any postprocedural complications. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Zuckerman in this issue.",

    "abstract": "Background Breast nonmass lesions (NMLs) are observed at screening and diagnostic US. However, knowledge is limited on imaging features of NMLs at screening US. Purpose To identify features of NMLs at screening US that are suspicious for malignancy based on mammographic findings. Materials and Methods This retrospective, multicenter study included asymptomatic women who underwent screening US between January 2012 and December 2019. Eligible women had NMLs at US, concurrent screening mammography, and record of a final diagnosis. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with malignancy. The diagnostic performance of each sonographic feature according to mammographic findings was calculated. A reader study was performed to assess interreader agreement for sonographic features. Results Among 993 NMLs in 993 patients (mean age, 50 years ± 9 [SD]), 914 (92.0%) were benign and 79 (8.0%) were malignant. Mean size was larger for malignant NMLs than for benign NMLs (2.6 cm ± 1.1 vs 1.9 cm ± 0.8; P < .001). In multivariable analysis, associated calcifications (odds ratio [OR], 21.6 [95% CI: 8.0, 58.2]; P < .001), posterior shadowing (OR, 6.9 [95% CI: 2.6, 18.4]; P < .001), segmental distribution (OR, 6.2 [95% CI: 2.7, 14.4]; P < .001), mixed echogenicity (OR, 5.0 [95% CI: 1.8, 14.0]; P < .001), and size (OR, 1.5 [95% CI: 1.1, 2.1]; P = .01) at US were associated with malignancy. Associated calcifications, posterior shadowing, segmental distribution, and mixed echogenicity showed positive predictive values (PPVs) of 44%, 22%, 22.9%, and 16.6%, respectively. Having a negative mammogram was associated with a lower malignancy rate (2.8% vs 28.8%) and lower PPVs for sonographic features (0.7%-10.4% vs 24%-55%) than having a positive mammogram. Interreader agreement for sonographic features was good to excellent (Fleiss κ 95% CI lower bound range, 0.63-0.81). Conclusion Calcifications, posterior shadowing, segmental distribution, and mixed echogenicity associated with NMLs can be considered suspicious features for malignancy at screening US. As malignancy rates and PPVs differ according to mammographic abnormalities, combined assessment is mandatory. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Left ventricular mass (LVM) is an established marker of cardiovascular risk; however, long-term follow-up studies in individuals with low to intermediate risk are lacking. Purpose To assess the sex-specific association of LVM measured with cardiac MRI with cardiovascular outcomes in those with a less than 20% 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Materials and Methods A total of 1528 volunteers older than 40 years of age with no history of CVD, a 10-year risk of CVD of less than 20%, and a B-type natriuretic peptide level greater than their sex-specific median underwent cardiac MRI between June 2008 and February 2013 as part of the Tayside Screening for Cardiac Events, or TASCFORCE, prospective study. LVM was indexed to body surface area, and the LVM-to-volume ratio was calculated. Follow-up for cardiovascular events was performed using national electronic health records. Cox proportional hazard models and Kaplan-Meier curves were applied to assess the impact of LVM. Results A total of 1495 participants (mean age, 54.5 years ± 8.3 [SD]; 925 female, 570 male) completed cardiac MRI, with a median follow-up of 10 years (IQR, 3 years). In female participants, LVM was associated with age, blood pressure, smoking status, and cholesterol level, while in male participants, LVM was associated with age and blood pressure. In female participants, the LVM-to-volume ratio was associated with cardiovascular events (hazard ratio [HR], 2.3 [95% CI: 1.1, 4.9] for the highest quartile vs the lowest quartile), while the LVM was not. In male participants, the LVM was associated with cardiovascular events (HR, 3.2 [95% CI: 1.5,7.0] for the highest quartile vs the lowest quartile), while the LVM-to-volume ratio was not. Conclusion In those with low to intermediate risk without established CVD, different remodeling patterns predict cardiovascular events, with increased LVM predictive in male participants, while LVM-to-volume ratio is predictive in female participants. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of numerous commercial and open-source models. While recent publications have explored OpenAI's GPT-4 to extract information of interest from radiology reports, there has not been a real-world comparison of GPT-4 to leading open-source models. Purpose To compare different leading open-source LLMs to GPT-4 on the task of extracting relevant findings from chest radiograph reports. Materials and Methods Two independent datasets of free-text radiology reports from chest radiograph examinations were used in this retrospective study performed between February 2, 2024, and February 14, 2024. The first dataset consisted of reports from the ImaGenome dataset, providing reference standard annotations from the MIMIC-CXR database acquired between 2011 and 2016. The second dataset consisted of randomly selected reports created at the Massachusetts General Hospital between July 2019 and July 2021. In both datasets, the commercial models GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 were compared with open-source models that included Mistral-7B and Mixtral-8 × 7B (Mistral AI), Llama 2-13B and Llama 2-70B (Meta), and Qwen1.5-72B (Alibaba Group), as well as CheXbert and CheXpert-labeler (Stanford ML Group), in their ability to accurately label the presence of multiple findings in radiograph text reports using zero-shot and few-shot prompting. The McNemar test was used to compare F1 scores between models. Results On the ImaGenome dataset (n = 450), the open-source model with the highest score, Llama 2-70B, achieved micro F1 scores of 0.97 and 0.97 for zero-shot and few-shot prompting, respectively, compared with the GPT-4 F1 scores of 0.98 and 0.98 (P > .99 and < .001 for superiority of GPT-4). On the institutional dataset (n = 500), the open-source model with the highest score, an ensemble model, achieved micro F1 scores of 0.96 and 0.97 for zero-shot and few-shot prompting, respectively, compared with the GPT-4 F1 scores of 0.98 and 0.97 (P < .001 and > .99 for superiority of GPT-4). Conclusion Although GPT-4 was superior to open-source models in zero-shot report labeling, few-shot prompting with a small number of example reports closely matched the performance of GPT-4. The benefit of few-shot prompting varied across datasets and models. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "title": "Impact of Patient-reported Symptom Information on the Interpretation of MRI of the Lumbar Spine.",
    "abstract": "Background Distinguishing lumbar pain generators from incidental findings at MRI can be difficult. Dictated reports may become lists of findings that cannot be ranked in order of diagnostic importance. Purpose To determine whether patient-reported symptom information can improve the interpretation of lumbar spine MRI by using the spine specialist as the reference standard. Materials and Methods This prospective, single-center, multireader study analyzed 240 participants who completed pre-MRI symptom questionnaires between May 2022 and February 2023. At the time of clinical MRI reporting, radiologists recorded pain generators in consecutive participants, creating two study groups by alternating interpretations with versus without symptom questionnaire results (SQR). Diagnostic certainty was recorded using a numeric scale of 0 to 100. Types, levels, and sides of pain generators were compared with reference diagnoses by calculating Cohen κ values with 95% CIs. Participant characteristics and diagnostic certainties were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum, Pearson χ2, or Kruskal-Wallis test. Interrater agreement was analyzed. Results There was no difference in age (P = .69) or sex (P = .60) between participants using SQR (n = 120; mean age, 61.0 years; 62 female) and not using SQR (n = 120; mean age, 62.5 years; 67 female). When radiologists were compared with specialists, agreements on pain generators were almost perfect for interpretations using SQR (type: κ = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.74,0.89]; level: κ = 0.88 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.95]; side: κ = 0.84 [95% CI: 0.75, 0.92]), but only fair to moderate for interpretations not using SQR (type: κ = 0.26 [95% CI: 0.15, 0.36]; level: κ = 0.51 [95% CI: 0.39, 0.63]; side: κ = 0.30 [95% CI: 0.18, 0.42]) (all P < .001). Diagnostic certainty was higher for MRI interpretations using SQR (mean, 80.4 ± 14.9 [SD]) than MRI interpretations not using SQR (60.5 ± 17.7) (P < .001). Interrater agreements were substantial (κ = 0.65-0.78) for MRI interpretations using SQR but only fair to moderate (κ = 0.24-0.49) for MRI interpretations not using SQR (all P < .001). Conclusion Patient-reported symptom information enabled radiologists to achieve nearly perfect diagnostic agreement with clinical experts. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Isikbay and Shah in this issue.",

    "abstract": "A 30-year-old female patient who was 25 weeks pregnant presented to the emergency department with a 1-month history of mild headache and 2 weeks of progressive somnolence and photophobia accompanied by binocular horizontal diplopia and right gaze deviation. The patient also described new neck pain with passive head movements, without neck stiffness. Overall, the pregnancy was uncomplicated, with no high-risk features. Fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and abdominal or chest pain were denied. The patient had no history of rash, intravenous drug use, immunosuppressive medication use, or documented congenital abnormalities. She had not traveled recently, although she lived in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, 2 years prior to presentation. There was no recent or recurrent bacterial or viral illness. At clinical examination, the patient exhibited a decreased level of alertness and appeared tired. Vital signs were unremarkable, with a normal temperature (37.1 °C). Cranial nerve assessment revealed mild right abducens nerve palsy; neurologic examination was otherwise normal. Fundoscopic examination showed moderate grade 3 papilledema, left greater than right, with obscuration of some of the vessels leaving the disk. A CT scan of the head at admission was interpreted as normal (Fig 1). MRI of the brain performed 5 days later, due to persistent symptoms, revealed infratentorial and supratentorial imaging abnormalities (Figs 2-5). Lumbar puncture revealed high cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure (32 cm H2O; upper limit of normal, 25 cm H2O). The CSF was clear, and analysis revealed an elevated total nucleated cell count (136 ×106/L; reference range, 0-5 ×106/L), with predominant lymphocytic moderate pleocytosis (100 ×106/L; reference range, 0-5 ×106/L) (59% lymphocytes) and normal glucose (3.3 mmol/L; reference range, 2.2-3.9 mmol/L) and normal total protein (0.27 g/L; reference range, 0.16-0.49 g/L) levels. Blood culture results for mycobacteria and anaerobic and aerobic microorganisms showed no growth. Findings from extensive additional diagnostic workup, including serologic testing for herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, enterovirus, Brucella, Coccidioides, Histoplasma, and mycobacteria, were negative. The HIV test result was negative, and the CD4 lymphocyte count and complement and immunoglobulin levels were within normal range. Autoimmune screening results were also negative.",

    "title": "Predicting Recurrence after Sublobar Resection in Patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma Using Preoperative Chest CT Scans.",
    "abstract": "Background Sublobar resection for lung cancer is usually guided by cutoff values for consolidation size (maximal diameter of the solid tumor component) and consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR). The effects of these factors as continuous variables and the reason for established cutoffs are, to the knowledge of the authors, unexplored. Purpose To quantitatively assess the predictive value of CTR and consolidation size for cancer recurrence risk after sublobar resection in clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma. Materials and Methods This retrospective study reviewed sublobar resection for clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma performed between January 2010 and December 2019. A restricted cubic spline function verified linearity by estimating recurrence probabilities using CTR and consolidation size obtained on preoperative CT scans. Statistical analyses included a Cox proportional hazards model to identify risk factors for cancer recurrence and the Cochran-Armitage trend test for the association between CTR and consolidation size. Results Of 1032 enrolled patients (age, 63.9 years ± 9.9 [SD]; 464 male patients), 523 (50.7%) and 509 (49.3%) underwent wedge resection and segmentectomy, respectively. Among patients with a CTR between 1% and 50% (n = 201), 187 (93.0%) had a consolidation size of less than or equal to 10 mm (P < .001). There was a positive association between the risk of recurrence with CTR and consolidation size (r2 = 0.727; P < .001). The recurrence rate showed the greatest increase when CTR was greater than 50% or consolidation size was greater than 10 mm. Specifically, the recurrence rate increased from 2.1% (three of 146) at 26%-50% CTR to 8.3% (nine of 108) at 51%-75% CTR, and from 4.4% (eight of 183) for 6-10-mm consolidation size to 11.9% (23 of 194) for 11-15-mm consolidation size. The probability of recurrence exhibited linearity and increased with CTR and consolidation size. Conclusion Cancer recurrence risk after sublobar resection for stage IA adenocarcinoma consistently rises with CTR and consolidation size. Current guideline cutoffs for sublobar resection remain clinically relevant given observed recurrence rates. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

Eleven years prior, the patient had undergone left ovarian cystectomy for treatment of endometrioma, as well as excision of deep infiltrating endometriosis. The oocyte retrieval procedure, where more than 30 eggs were retrieved, was complicated by ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and intraperitoneal bleeding, which necessitated admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for 3 days. Following discharge from the ICU, the patient experienced occasional on-and-off pressure of the urinary bladder and persistent aching pelvic pain. At the 1-month follow-up appointment, the patient's vital signs were assessed (blood pressure, 142/94 mm Hg; pulse rate, 95 per minute; temperature, 96.8 °F [36 °C]). Routine blood investigations, including white blood cell count, were within normal limits. Physical examination showed the abdomen was soft but there was mild pelvic tenderness. The serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin test result was negative for pregnancy, and urinalysis testing showed no leukocyte esterase or nitrites. MRI of the pelvis was performed to evaluate the worsening pain.",

    "abstract": "Background An artificial intelligence (AI)-based method for measuring intraprostatic tumor volume based on data from MRI may provide prognostic information. Purpose To evaluate whether the total volume of intraprostatic tumor from AI-generated segmentations (VAI) provides independent prognostic information in patients with localized prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy (RT) or radical prostatectomy (RP). Materials and Methods For this retrospective, single-center study (January 2021 to August 2023), patients with cT1-3N0M0 prostate cancer who underwent MRI and were treated with RT or RP were identified. Patients who underwent RT were randomly divided into cross-validation and test RT groups. An AI segmentation algorithm was trained to delineate Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 3-5 lesions in the cross-validation RT group before providing segmentations for the test RT and RP groups. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the association between VAI and time to metastasis and adjusted for clinical and radiologic factors for combined RT (ie, cross-validation RT and test RT) and RP groups. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were calculated for VAI and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk categorization for prediction of 5-year metastasis (RP group) and 7-year metastasis (combined RT group). Results Overall, 732 patients were included (combined RT group, 438 patients; RP group, 294 patients). Median ages were 68 years (IQR, 62-73 years) and 61 years (IQR, 56-66 years) for the combined RT group and the RP group, respectively. VAI was associated with metastasis in the combined RT group (median follow-up, 6.9 years; adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 1.09 per milliliter increase; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.15; P = .001) and the RP group (median follow-up, 5.5 years; AHR, 1.22; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.39; P = .001). AUCs for 7-year metastasis for the combined RT group for VAI and NCCN risk category were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.94) and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.98), respectively (P = .02). Five-year AUCs for the RP group for VAI and NCCN risk category were 0.89 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.98) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.94), respectively (P = .25).

    "title": "Intersystem and Interoperator Agreement of US Attenuation Coefficient for Quantifying Liver Steatosis.",
    "abstract": "Background The extent of liver steatosis can be assessed using US attenuation coefficient (AC) algorithms currently implemented in several US systems. However, little is known about intersystem and interoperator variability in measurements. Purpose To assess intersystem and interoperator agreement in US AC measurements for fat quantification in individuals with varying degrees of liver steatosis and to assess the correlation of each manufacturer's AC algorithm results with MRI proton density fat fraction (PDFF). Materials and Methods This prospective study was conducted at Southwoods Imaging, Youngstown, Ohio, September 30-October 1, 2023. Two operators independently obtained AC measurements using eight US systems equipped with an AC algorithm from different manufacturers. On the same day, MRI PDFF measurement was performed by a different operator. Correlation between US AC and MRI PDFF was assessed using a mixed-effects model. Agreement between systems and operators was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results Twenty-six individuals (mean age, 55.4 years ± 10.7 [SD]; 16 female participants) were evaluated. The correlation of US AC with MRI PDFF was high for five AC algorithms (r range, 0.70-0.86), moderate for two (r = 0.62 for both), and poor for one (r = 0.47). In pairwise comparisons, none of the pairs of systems achieved excellent agreement (overall ICC = 0.33 [95% CI: 0.15, 0.52]). One pair showed good agreement (ICC = 0.79 [95% CI: 0.66, 0.87]), eight pairs showed moderate agreement (ICC range, 0.50 [95% CI: 0.22, 0.69] to 0.73 [95% CI: 0.49, 0.85]), and 19 pairs showed poor agreement (ICC range, 0.11 [95% CI: -0.06, 0.37] to 0.48 [95% CI: 0.20, 0.67]). Interoperator agreement on AC value was excellent for the Samsung Medison algorithm (ICC = 0.90 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.96]), good for the Siemens Healthineers (ICC = 0.76 [95% CI: 0.54, 0.89]) and Canon Medical Systems (ICC = 0.76 [95% CI: 0.16, 0.92]) algorithms, and moderate for the remaining algorithms (ICC range, 0.50 [95% CI: 0.16, 0.73] to 0.74 [95% CI: 0.51, 0.88]). The mean AC value obtained by the two operators did not differ for any system except the system from Canon Medical Systems. Conclusion There was substantial variability in AC values obtained with different US systems, precluding interchangeability between systems for liver steatosis diagnosis and follow-up imaging. Interoperator agreement ranged from moderate to excellent. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article. See also the editorial by Han in this issue.",

    "title": "Evaluating the Performance and Bias of Natural Language Processing Tools in Labeling Chest Radiograph Reports.",
    "abstract": "Background Natural language processing (NLP) is commonly used to annotate radiology datasets for training deep learning (DL) models. However, the accuracy and potential biases of these NLP methods have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly across different demographic groups. Purpose To evaluate the accuracy and demographic bias of four NLP radiology report labeling tools on two chest radiograph datasets. Materials and Methods This retrospective study, performed between April 2022 and April 2024, evaluated chest radiograph report labeling using four NLP tools (CheXpert [rule-based], RadReportAnnotator [RRA; DL-based], OpenAI's GPT-4 [DL-based], cTAKES [hybrid]) on a subset of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) chest radiograph dataset balanced for representation of age, sex, and race and ethnicity (n = 692) and the entire Indiana University (IU) chest radiograph dataset (n = 3665). Three board-certified radiologists annotated the chest radiograph reports for 14 thoracic disease labels. NLP tool performance was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy and error rate. Bias was evaluated by comparing performance between demographic subgroups using the Pearson χ2 test. Results The IU dataset included 3665 patients (mean age, 49.7 years ± 17 [SD]; 1963 female), while the MIMIC dataset included 692 patients (mean age, 54.1 years ± 23.1; 357 female). All four NLP tools demonstrated high accuracy across findings in the IU and MIMIC datasets, as follows: CheXpert (92.6% [47 516 of 51 310], 90.2% [8742 of 9688]), RRA (82.9% [19 746 of 23 829], 92.2% [2870 of 3114]), GPT-4 (94.3% [45 586 of 48 342], 91.6% [6721 of 7336]), and cTAKES (84.7% [43 436 of 51 310], 88.7% [8597 of 9688]). RRA and cTAKES had higher accuracy (P < .001) on the MIMIC dataset, while CheXpert and GPT-4 had higher accuracy on the IU dataset. Differences (P < .001) in error rates were observed across age groups for all NLP tools except RRA on the MIMIC dataset, with the highest error rates for CheXpert, RRA, and cTAKES in patients older than 80 years (mean, 15.8% ± 5.0) and the highest error rate for GPT-4 in patients 60-80 years of age (8.3%). Conclusion Although commonly used NLP tools for chest radiograph report annotation are accurate when evaluating reports in aggregate, demographic subanalyses showed significant bias, with poorer performance in older patients. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Current guidelines recommend radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as the first-line treatment for benign thyroid nodules. Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety of microwave ablation (MWA) and RFA for the treatment of predominantly solid benign thyroid nodules. Materials and Methods This prospective, randomized, open-label, multicenter study was conducted from August 2019 to February 2023. Participants with nonfunctioning, predominantly solid benign thyroid nodules from five institutions were randomly assigned with a 1:1 ratio to receive MWA or RFA treatment. Participants were followed up for at least 2 years. Primary outcomes were 6-month and 2-year volume reduction rate (VRR) of nodules after ablation. Secondary outcomes included VRR change over time, complications, and technique efficacy (defined as volumetric reduction ≥ 50% of the initial nodule volume). Continuous variables and categorical variables were compared using the t test and the χ2 test or Fisher exact test, respectively. Results This study included 76 participants in the MWA group (mean age, 46 years ± 12 [SD]; 58 female participants) and 76 in the RFA group (mean age, 50 years ± 13; 56 female participants). MWA was noninferior to RFA in terms of 6-month (mean difference, -5.6%; P = .01) and 2-year (-2.4%; P < .001) VRR after ablation. Comparing MWA and RFA, no evidence of a difference was observed for VRR change over time (mean difference from mixed-effects analysis, 6.9% [95% CI: -0.5, 13.9]; P = .73) or technique efficacy (91% vs 86%; P = .40). The most common major complication was voice change, which occurred in 6.6% of participants in the MWA group and 1.3% of participants in the RFA group (P = .21). Conclusion MWA and RFA showed comparable efficacy for treating participants with predominantly solid benign thyroid nodules. However, a larger sample size is needed to demonstrate that safety is comparable between the procedures.

    "abstract": "Screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) in a high-risk population, as defined by age and smoking behavior, reduces lung cancer-related mortality. However, LDCT screening presents a major challenge. Numerous, mostly benign, nodules are seen in the lungs during screening. The question is how to distinguish the malignant from the benign nodules. Various studies use different protocols for nodule management. The Dutch-Belgian NELSON (Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek) trial, the largest European lung cancer screening trial, used distinctions based on nodule volumetric assessment and growth rate. This review discusses key findings from the NELSON study regarding the characteristics of screening-detected nodules, including nodule size and its volumetric assessment, growth rate, subtype, and their associated malignancy risk. These results are compared with findings from other screening studies and current recommendations for lung nodule management. By examining differences in nodule management strategies and providing a comprehensive overview of outcomes specific to lung cancer screening, this review aims to contribute to the broader discussion on optimizing lung nodule management in screening programs.",

Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify parameters associated with each molecular subtype and pCR. A predictive model based on associated parameters was constructed, and its performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared by using the DeLong test. The time-dependent diffusion MRI parameters were validated based on correlation with pathologic measurements. Results The analysis included 408 participants with breast cancer (mean age, 51.9 years ± 9.1 [SD]). Of these, 221 participants were administered neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 54 (24.4%) achieved pCR. The time-dependent diffusion MRI parameters showed reasonable performance in helping to identify luminal A (AUC, 0.70), luminal B (AUC, 0.78), and triple-negative breast cancer (AUC, 0.72) subtypes and high performance for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched breast cancer (AUC, 0.85), outperforming ADC measurements (all P < .05). Progesterone receptor status (odds ratio [OR], 0.08; P = .02), HER2 status (OR, 3.36; P = .009), and the cellularity index (OR, 0.01; P = .02) were independently associated with the odds of achieving pCR. The combined model showed high performance for predicting pCR (AUC, 0.88), outperforming ADC measurements and the clinical-pathologic model (AUC, 0.73 and 0.79, respectively; P < .001). The time-dependent diffusion MRI-estimated parameters correlated well with the pathologic measurements (n = 100; r = 0.67-0.81; P < .001). Conclusion Time-dependent diffusion MRI-based microstructural mapping was an effective method for helping to predict molecular subtypes and pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in participants with breast cancer. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Impact on Prognosis of Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Secondary to Delays in Diagnostic Workup.",
    "abstract": "Background Diagnostic workup of small pulmonary nodules often requires follow-up CT scans to confirm nodule growth before invasive diagnostics or treatment. Purpose To confirm prior results from the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program (I-ELCAP) on quantifying decreases in lung cancer prognosis by using two large databases, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, a model was developed to predict cure rates based on size of solid nodules using the NLST (August 2002 to summer 2007) and IASLC (January 2011 to December 2019) databases, focusing on stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Kaplan-Meier methods were used to calculate 10-year lung cancer-specific survival and 5-year overall survival rates for different tumor sizes. Tumor diameter increases after 90-, 180-, and 365-day delays were estimated using volume doubling times (VDTs) of 60, 120, and 240 days corresponding to fast, moderate, and slow tumor growth. Initial and delayed lung cancer cure rates were assessed across nine scenarios of time delays and tumor growth rates and compared with the previous results of the I-ELCAP database. Results Using regression models based on 166 NLST and 22 590 IASLC patients with NSCLC, 10-year lung cancer-specific survival and 5-year overall survival, respectively, for tumors 4.0-20.0 mm in diameter were estimated. For a 20.0-mm tumor with a 60-day VDT in the NLST database, the lung cancer-specific survival decreased from 83.4% to 76.5%, 66.8%, and 32.3% after 90, 180, and 365 days, respectively. The IASLC database showed similar decreases in 5-year overall survival, from 81.2% to 73.4%, 62.4%, and 23.3% after 90, 180, and 365 days, respectively. Comparison across NLST, IASLC, and I-ELCAP databases revealed minor variations in lung cancer cure rates between 79.9% and 83.4%, with reductions of 6.9%-8.3% after a 180-day delay with a 120-day VDT. Conclusion The NLST and IASLC databases confirmed prior estimates from the I-ELCAP database for the decrease in lung cancer prognosis due to diagnostic delays. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Coronary MR angiography (CMRA) at 3 T offers higher signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio compared with 1.5 T. CMRA at 5 T may provide better diagnostic performance. Purpose To assess the feasibility and clinical application of 5-T noncontrast whole-heart CMRA and compare 5-T acquisition with 3-T acquisition. Materials and Methods From September 2023 to April 2024, patients scheduled for coronary CT angiography (CCTA) and volunteers were prospectively recruited. CCTA served as the reference standard in patients. CMRA was performed using a 3-T spectral attenuated inversion-recovery (3TSPAIR) sequence and 3-T Dixon (3TDixon) sequence with routine spatial resolution (3TSPAIR-routine and 3TDixon-routine, respectively), and 5-T Dixon (5TDixon) with routine and high spatial resolution (5TDixon-routine and 5TDixon-high, respectively). The study evaluated image quality, coronary artery calcium (CAC), the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) graded according to Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System, and the presence of ≥50% coronary stenosis. The nonparametric paired Wilcoxon signed rank test, McNemar test, generalized estimating equation model, and kappa test were used. Results Eight volunteers and 79 patients were included (mean age, 52 years ± 11 [SD]; 48 male). Image quality was higher for 5TDixon-routine compared with 3TSPAIR-routine and 3TDixon-routine (P < .001 for both) and similar for 5TDixon-high (P = .60). The per-segment sensitivity for CAC was higher at 5TDixon-high than 5TDixon-routine (78.3% vs 53.3%; P < .001), with no difference in specificity (98.6% vs 98.6%; P > .99). In grading the severity of CAD, 5TDixon-routine showed better consistency with CCTA than 3TSPAIR-routine (κ = 0.46 vs 0.13) and 3TDixon-routine (κ = 0.55 vs 0.42). For detecting ≥50% stenosis, the per-patient sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were as follows: 5TDixon-routine versus 3TSPAIR-routine, 88.9% versus 55.6%, 86.5% versus 62.2%, and 87.0% versus 60.9% (P = .55, .01, and .18, respectively); 5TDixon-routine versus 3TDixon-routine, 90.0% versus 80.0%, 86.8% versus 71.1%, and 87.5% versus 72.9%, respectively (P > .05 for all). Conclusion Noncontrast CMRA at 5 T shows potential to evaluate CAC and coronary stenosis simultaneously and demonstrates superior diagnostic performance compared with at 3 T. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background There is variable evidence and no randomized trials on the benefit of US elastography-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) over conventional US-guided FNAC alone for thyroid nodules. Purpose To compare the efficacy of US elastography-guided FNAC versus US-guided FNAC in reducing nondiagnostic rates for thyroid nodules. Materials and Methods A pragmatic, multicenter randomized controlled trial was performed at 18 secondary and tertiary hospitals across England between February 2015 and September 2018. Eligible adults with single or multiple thyroid nodules who had not previously undergone FNAC were randomized (1:1 ratio) to US elastography FNAC (intervention) or conventional US FNAC (control). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who have a nondiagnostic cytologic Thy1 (British Thyroid Association system) result following the first FNAC. Results A total of 982 participants (mean age, 51.3 years ± 15 [SD] [IQR, 39-63]; male-to-female ratio, 1:4) were randomized. Of the 493 participants who underwent US elastography, 467 (94.7%) were examined with strain US elastography. There was no difference between the two arms in the nondiagnostic (Thy1) rate following the first FNAC (19% vs 16%; risk difference [RD], 0.03 [95% CI: -0.01, 0.07]; P = .11) or in the median time to reach the final definitive diagnosis (3.3 months [IQR, 1.5-6.4] for US elastography FNAC vs 3.4 months [IQR, 1.5-6.2] for US FNAC). All sensitivity analyses supported the primary analysis. Fewer participants in the US elastography FNAC arm underwent diagnostic hemithyroidectomy than in the US FNAC arm (183 of 493 [37%] vs 196 of 489 [40%]), but this was not statistically significant (adjusted RD, 0.02 [95% CI: -0.06, 0.01]; P = 0.15). There was no evidence of a difference in malignancy rates between the two arms: 70 of 493 (14%) in US elastography FNAC arm versus 79 of 489 (16%) in US FNAC arm (P = .39). There was also no difference in the rate of benign histologic findings between the groups (RD, -0.01 [95% CI: -0.04, 0.03]; P = .7). Conclusion Strain US elastography does not appear to have additional benefit over conventional US FNAC in the diagnosis of malignancy in thyroid nodules. Clinical trial registration no.

    "title": "Prediction of Ischemic Stroke Functional Outcomes from Acute-Phase Noncontrast CT and Clinical Information.",
    "abstract": "Background Clinical outcome prediction based on acute-phase ischemic stroke data is valuable for planning health care resources, designing clinical trials, and setting patient expectations. Existing methods require individualized features and often involve manually engineered, time-consuming postprocessing activities. Purpose To predict the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score with a deep learning (DL) model fusing noncontrast-enhanced CT (NCCT) and clinical information from the acute phase of stroke. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included data from six patient datasets from four multicenter trials and two registries. The DL-based imaging and clinical model was trained by using NCCT data obtained 1-7 days after baseline imaging and clinical data (age; sex; baseline and 24-hour National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores; and history of hypertension, diabetes, and atrial fibrillation). This model was compared with models based on either NCCT or clinical information alone. Model-specific mRS score prediction accuracy, mRS score accuracy within 1 point of the actual mRS score, mean absolute error (MAE), and performance in identifying unfavorable outcomes (mRS score, >2) were evaluated. Results A total of 1335 patients (median age, 71 years; IQR, 60-80 years; 674 female patients) were included for model development and testing through sixfold cross validation, with distributions of 979, 133, and 223 patients across training, validation, and test sets in each of the six cross-validation folds, respectively. The fused model achieved an MAE of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.98) for predicting the specific mRS score, outperforming the imaging-only (MAE, 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.16; P < .001) and the clinical information-only (MAE, 1.00; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.05; P = .04) models. The fused model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.92) for predicting unfavorable outcomes, outperforming the clinical information-only model (AUC, 0.88; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.90; P < .001) and the imaging-only model (AUC, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.84, 0.87; P < .001). Conclusion A fused DL-based NCCT and clinical model outperformed an imaging-only model and a clinical-information-only model in predicting 90-day mRS scores. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Meta-Analysis of Interobserver Agreement in Assessment of Interstitial Lung Disease Using High-Resolution CT.",
    "abstract": "Background High-resolution CT (HRCT) is central to the assessment of interstitial lung disease (ILD), and accurate classification of disease has important implications for patients. Evaluation of imaging features can be challenging, even for experienced thoracic radiologists. Previous work has provided equivocal evidence on the interpretation of HRCT features at ILD-related imaging. Purpose To perform a meta-analysis to assess the level of agreement among expert thoracic radiologists in interpreting ILD-related imaging. Materials and Methods A systematic literature search from January 2000 to October 2023 of the Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases was performed for articles reporting assessments of interobserver agreement between thoracic radiologists for evaluation of ILD findings, such as severity and progression of disease, presence of features such as honeycombing and ground-glass opacification, and classification based on the 2011 and 2018 American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/Japanese Respiratory Society/Asociación Latinoamericana del Tórax (ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT) guidelines for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to obtain pooled κ or intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values as measures of interobserver agreement. Results The final analysis included 13 studies consisting of 6943 images and 146 radiologists. In 10 studies assessing agreement of specific radiologic findings in ILD, the pooled κ value was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.70). In eight studies, the assessed interobserver agreement of the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT diagnostic guidelines for IPF based on usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) patterns, the pooled κ value was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.74). One study reported a κ value of 0.87 for ILD progression. Seven studies assessing ILD severity could not be pooled; the individual κ values for ILD severity ranged from 0.64 to 0.90, and ICC values ranged from 0.63 to 0.96. Conclusion There was moderate agreement between thoracic radiologists when assessing ILD features and UIP pattern diagnosis but little evidence on agreement of disease severity, extent, or progression.

    "abstract": "Background Coronary CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) has been used in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD); however, whether it decreases invasive coronary angiography (ICA) use and affects prognosis remains insufficiently evidenced. Purpose To explore the effectiveness of adding CT-FFR to routine coronary CT angiography (CCTA) on short-term ICA rate and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a Chinese setting. Materials and Methods A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted in 17 Chinese centers, with patient inclusion from May 2021 to September 2021. Eligible individuals with 25%-99% stenosis at CCTA were randomly assigned 1:1 to a strategy of CCTA plus automated CT-FFR or CCTA alone for guiding downstream care. The primary end point was the ICA rate 90 days after enrollment. Secondary end points included 90-day and 1-year MACE rates (comprised of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization) and 1-year cardiac events (comprised of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization). The Cox proportional hazards model with center effect adjustment was used for survival comparisons. Results A total of 5297 participants (mean age, 63.5 years ± 10.8 [SD]; 3178 male) were included. During the 90-day follow-up, ICA was performed in 263 of 2633 participants (10.0%) in the CCTA plus CT-FFR group and 327 of 2640 participants (12.4%) in the CCTA-alone group (absolute rate difference: -2.40%; 95% CI: -4.10, -0.70; P = .006). The MACE rates at 90 days (0.5% [12 of 2633 participants] vs 0.8% [21 of 2640 participants]; P = .12) and 1 year (2.9% [74 of 2546 participants] vs 2.8% [72 of 2531 participants]; P = .90) were similar for both groups. At 1-year follow-up, fewer cardiac events were observed in the CCTA plus CT-FFR group compared with the CCTA-alone group (0.5% vs 1.1%; adjusted hazard ratio: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.99; P = .047). Conclusion CT-FFR added to CCTA led to a lower 90-day ICA rate and similar 1-year MACE rate in a Chinese real-world setting. Further follow-up is warranted to demonstrate the long-term prognostic value of this management approach. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Testing the Ability and Limitations of ChatGPT to Generate Differential Diagnoses from Transcribed Radiologic Findings.",
    "abstract": "Background The burgeoning interest in ChatGPT as a potentially useful tool in medicine highlights the necessity for systematic evaluation of its capabilities and limitations. Purpose To evaluate the accuracy, reliability, and repeatability of differential diagnoses produced by ChatGPT from transcribed radiologic findings. Materials and Methods Cases selected from a radiology textbook series spanning a variety of imaging modalities, subspecialties, and anatomic pathologies were converted into standardized prompts that were entered into ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 algorithms; April 3 to June 1, 2023). Responses were analyzed for accuracy via comparison with the final diagnosis and top 3 differential diagnosis provided in the textbook, which served as the ground truth. Reliability, defined based on the frequency of algorithmic hallucination, was assessed through the identification of factually incorrect statements and fabricated references. Comparisons were made between the algorithms using the McNemar test and a generalized estimating equation model framework. Test-retest repeatability was measured by obtaining 10 independent responses from both algorithms for 10 cases in each subspecialty, and calculating the average pairwise percent agreement and Krippendorff α. Results A total of 339 cases were collected across multiple radiologic subspecialties. The overall accuracy of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for final diagnosis was 53.7% (182 of 339) and 66.1% (224 of 339; P < .001), respectively. The mean differential score (ie, proportion of top 3 diagnoses that matched the original literature differential diagnosis) for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 was 0.50 and 0.54 (P = .06), respectively. Of the references provided in GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 responses, 39.9% (401 of 1006) and 14.3% (161 of 1124; P < .001), respectively, were fabricated. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 generated false statements in 16.2% (55 of 339) and 4.7% (16 of 339; P < .001) of cases, respectively. The range of average pairwise percent agreement across subspecialties for the final diagnosis and top 3 differential diagnosis was 59%-98% and 23%-49%, respectively. Conclusion ChatGPT achieved the best results when the most up-to-date model (GPT-4) was used and when it was prompted for a single diagnosis. Hallucination frequency was lower with GPT-4 than with GPT-3.5, but repeatability was an issue for both models. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background MRI is highly sensitive for assessing bone marrow involvement in multiple myeloma (MM) but does not enable detection of osteolysis. Purpose To assess the diagnostic accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility of pseudo-CT MRI sequences (zero echo time [ZTE], gradient-echo black bone [BB]) in detecting osteolytic lesions in MM using whole-body CT as the reference standard. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, consecutive patients were enrolled in our academic hospital between June 2021 and December 2022. Inclusion criteria were newly diagnosed MM, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance at high risk for MM, or suspicion of progressive MM. Participants underwent ZTE and BB sequences covering the lumbar spine, pelvis, and proximal femurs as part of 3-T whole-body MRI examinations, as well as clinically indicated fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT examination within 1 month that included optimized whole-body CT. Ten bone regions and two scores (categorical score = presence/absence of osteolytic lesion; semiquantitative score = osteolytic lesion count) were assessed by three radiologists (two experienced and one unfamiliar with pseudo-CT reading) on the ZTE, BB, and whole-body CT images. The accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility of categorical scores (according to Gwet agreement coefficients AC1 and AC2) and differences in semiquantitative scores were assessed at the per-sequence, per-region, and per-patient levels. Results A total of 47 participants (mean age, 67 years ± 11 [SD]; 27 male) were included. In experienced readers, BB and ZTE had the same high accuracy (98%) in the per-patient analysis, while BB accuracy ranged 83%-100% and ZTE accuracy ranged 74%-94% in the per-region analysis. An increase of false-negative (FN) findings in the spine ranging from +17% up to +23%, according to the lumbar vertebra, was observed using ZTE (P < .013). Regardless of the region (except coxal bones), differences in the BB score minus the ZTE score were positively skewed (P < .021). Regardless of the sequence or region, repeatability was very good (AC1 ≥0.87 for all), while reproducibility was at least good (AC2 ≥0.63 for all). Conclusion Both MRI-based ZTE and BB pseudo-CT sequences of the lumbar spine, pelvis, and femurs demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in detecting osteolytic lesions in MM. Compared with BB, the ZTE sequence yielded more FN findings in the spine. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05381077 Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

    "abstract": "The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) provides a quantitative measure of water mobility that can be used to probe alterations in tissue microstructure due to disease or treatment. Establishment of the accepted level of variance in ADC measurements for each clinical application is critical for its successful implementation. The Diffusion-Weighted Imaging Biomarker Committee of the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA) has recently advanced the ADC Profile from the consensus to clinically feasible stage for the brain, liver, prostate, and breast. This profile distills multiple studies on ADC repeatability and describes detailed procedures to achieve stated performance claims on an observed ADC change within acceptable confidence limits. In addition to reviewing the current ADC Profile claims, this report has used recent literature to develop proposed updates for establishing metrology benchmarks for mean lesion ADC change that account for measurement variance. Specifically, changes in mean ADC exceeding 8% for brain lesions, 27% for liver lesions, 27% for prostate lesions, and 15% for breast lesions are claimed to represent true changes with 95% confidence. This report also discusses the development of the ADC Profile, highlighting its various stages, and describes the workflow essential to achieving a standardized implementation of advanced quantitative diffusion-weighted MRI in the clinic. The presented QIBA ADC Profile guidelines should enable successful clinical application of ADC as a quantitative imaging biomarker and ensure reproducible ADC measurements that can be used to confidently evaluate longitudinal changes and treatment response for individual patients.",

    "title": "Detectability of Hypoattenuating Liver Lesions with Deep Learning CT Reconstruction: A Phantom and Patient Study.",
    "abstract": "Background CT deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) improves image quality by reducing noise compared with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-V (ASIR-V). However, objective assessment of low-contrast lesion detectability is lacking. Purpose To investigate low-contrast detectability of hypoattenuating liver lesions on CT scans reconstructed with DLIR compared with CT scans reconstructed with ASIR-V in a patient and a phantom study. Materials and Methods This single-center retrospective study included patients undergoing portal venous phase abdominal CT between February and May 2021 and a low-contrast-resolution phantom scanned with the same protocol. Four reconstructions (ASIR-V at 40% strength [ASIR-V 40] and DLIR at three strengths) were generated. Five radiologists qualitatively assessed the images using the five-point Likert scale for image quality, lesion diagnostic confidence, conspicuity, and small lesion (≤1 cm) visibility. Up to two key lesions per patient, confirmed at histopathologic testing or at prior or follow-up imaging studies, were included. Lesion-to-background contrast-to-noise ratio was calculated. Interreader variability was analyzed. Intergroup qualitative and quantitative metrics were compared between DLIR and ASIR-V 40 using proportional odds logistic regression models. Results Eighty-six liver lesions (mean size, 15 mm ± 9.5 [SD]) in 50 patients (median age, 62 years [IQR, 57-73 years]; 27 [54%] female patients) were included. Differences were not detected for various qualitative low-contrast detectability metrics between ASIR-V 40 and DLIR (P > .05). Quantitatively, medium-strength DLIR and high-strength DLIR yielded higher lesion-to-background contrast-to-noise ratios than ASIR-V 40 (medium-strength DLIR vs ASIR-V 40: odds ratio [OR], 1.96 [95% CI: 1.65, 2.33]; high-strength DLIR vs ASIR-V 40: OR, 5.36 [95% CI: 3.68, 7.82]; P < .001). Low-contrast lesion attenuation was reduced by 2.8-3.6 HU with DLIR. Interreader agreement was moderate to very good for the qualitative metrics. Subgroup analysis based on lesion size of larger than 1 cm and 1 cm or smaller yielded similar results (P > .05). Qualitatively, phantom study results were similar to those in patients (P > .05). Conclusion The detectability of low-contrast liver lesions was similar on CT scans reconstructed with low-, medium-, and high-strength DLIR and ASIR-V 40 in both patient and phantom studies. Lesion-to-background contrast-to-noise ratios were higher for DLIR medium- and high-strength reconstructions compared with ASIR-V 40. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "title": "Enhancing Radiologist Reading Performance by Ordering Screening Mammograms Based on Characteristics That Promote Visual Adaptation.",
    "abstract": "Background Mammographic background characteristics may stimulate human visual adaptation, allowing radiologists to detect abnormalities more effectively. However, it is unclear whether density, or another image characteristic, drives visual adaptation. Purpose To investigate whether screening performance improves when screening mammography examinations are ordered for batch reading according to mammographic characteristics that may promote visual adaptation. Materials and Methods This retrospective multireader multicase study was performed with mammograms obtained between September 2016 and May 2019. The screening examinations, each consisting of four mammograms, were interpreted by 13 radiologists in three distinct orders: randomly, by increasing volumetric breast density (VBD), and based on a self-supervised learning (SSL) encoding (examinations automatically grouped as \"looking similar\"). An eye tracker recorded radiologists' eye movements during interpretation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of random-ordered readings were compared with those of VBD- and SSL-ordered readings using mixed-model analysis of variance. Reading time, fixation metrics, and perceived density were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results Mammography examinations (75 with breast cancer, 75 without breast cancer) from 150 women (median age, 55 years [IQR, 50-63]) were read. The examinations ordered by increasing VBD versus randomly had an increased AUC (0.93 [95% CI: 0.91, 0.96] vs 0.92 [95% CI: 0.89, 0.95]; P = .009), without evidence of a difference in specificity (89% [871 of 975] vs 86% [837 of 975], P = .04) and sensitivity (both 81% [794 of 975 vs 788 of 975], P = .78), and a reduced reading time (24.3 vs 27.9 seconds, P < .001), fixation count (47 vs 52, P < .001), and fixation time in malignant regions (3.7 vs 4.6 seconds, P < .001). For SSL-ordered readings, there was no evidence of differences in AUC (0.92 [95% CI: 0.89, 0.95]; P = .70), specificity (84% [820 of 975], P = .37), sensitivity (80% [784 of 975], P = .79), fixation count (54, P = .05), or fixation time in malignant regions (4.6 seconds, P > .99) compared with random-ordered readings. Reading times were significantly higher for SSL-ordered readings compared with random-ordered readings (28.4 seconds, P = .02). Conclusion Screening mammography examinations ordered from low to high VBD improved screening performance while reducing reading and fixation times. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background The Ovarian-Adnexal Imaging Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) US risk score can be used to accurately stratify ovarian lesions based on morphologic characteristics. However, there are no large multicenter studies assessing the potential impact of using O-RADS US version 2022 risk score in patients referred for surgery for an ovarian or adnexal lesion. Purpose To retrospectively determine the proportion of patients with ovarian or adnexal lesions without acute symptoms who may have been managed conservatively by using the O-RADS US version 2022 risk score. Materials and Methods This multicenter retrospective study included patients with ovarian cystic lesions and nonacute symptoms who underwent surgical resection after US before the introduction of O-RADS US between January 2011 and December 2014. Investigators blinded to the final diagnoses recorded lesion imaging features and O-RADS US risk scores. The frequency of malignancy and the diagnostic performance of the risk score were calculated. The Mann-Whitney test and Fisher exact test were performed, with P < .05 indicating a statistically significant difference. Results A total of 377 patients with surgically resected lesions were included. Among the resected lesions, 42% (157 of 377) were assigned an O-RADS US risk score of 2. Of the O-RADS US 2 lesions, 54% (86 of 157) were nonneoplastic, 45% (70 of 157) were dermoids or other benign tumors, and less than 1% (one of 157) were malignant. Using O-RADS US 4 as the optimal threshold for malignancy prediction yielded a 94% (68 of 72) sensitivity, 64% (195 of 305) specificity, 38% (68 of 178) positive predictive value, and 98% (195 of 199) negative predictive value. Conclusion In patients without acute symptoms who underwent surgery for ovarian and adnexal lesions before the O-RADS US risk score was published, nearly half (42%) of surgically resected lesions retrospectively met the O-RADS US 2 version 2022 criteria. In these patients, imaging follow-up or conservative management could have been offered. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis and recurrent symptoms of portal hypertension is primarily assessed with US and confirmed with invasive catheter venography, which can be used to measure the portosystemic pressure gradient (PSPG) to identify TIPS-refractory portal hypertension. To avoid the risks and costs of invasive catheter venography, noninvasive PSPG evaluation strategies are needed. Purpose To demonstrate the feasibility of the combination of four-dimensional (4D) flow MRI with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for noninvasive PSPG assessment in participants with cirrhosis and TIPS. Materials and Methods Abdominal 4D flow MRI was performed prospectively in participants with cirrhosis and TIPS between January 2019 and September 2020. Flow rates were measured within the TIPS and inferior vena cava (IVC). The portal vein (PV), TIPS, right hepatic vein, and IVC were segmented on MRI scans to create a CFD mesh. The PV and infrahepatic IVC were defined as inflows for 4D flow MRI-derived flow rates. The suprahepatic IVC was defined as the outflow. CFD simulations were used to noninvasively estimate PSPG as the difference between the simulated pressures in the PV and suprahepatic IVC. Invasive venographic measurements of the PSPG served as the reference standard, and Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between noninvasive estimates and invasive measurements. Results In all 20 participants with cirrhosis (mean age, 58 years ± 9 [SD]; 11 men), 4D flow MRI-based CFD simulations enabled visualization of flow velocities and pressure distributions within the segmented vasculature and TIPS. Noninvasive estimates and invasive measures of PSPG were strongly correlated (r = 0.77; P < .001). The 4D flow MRI-based CFD simulations correctly classified the presence or absence of a post-TIPS PSPG greater than 12 mm Hg in 16 of 20 participants (80%). Conclusion The combination of 4D flow MRI and CFD was feasible for noninvasive PSPG assessment in participants with cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and TIPS. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Motosugi and Watanabe in this issue.",

    "abstract": "Background Mammogram interpretation is challenging in female patients with extremely dense breasts (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] category D), who have a higher breast cancer risk. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) has recently emerged as a potential alternative; however, data regarding CEM utility in this subpopulation are limited. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic performance of CEM for breast cancer screening in female patients with extremely dense breasts. Materials and Methods This retrospective single-institution study included consecutive CEM examinations in asymptomatic female patients with extremely dense breasts performed from December 2012 to March 2022. From CEM examinations, low-energy (LE) images were the equivalent of a two-dimensional full-field digital mammogram. Recombined images highlighting areas of contrast enhancement were constructed using a postprocessing algorithm. The sensitivity and specificity of LE images and CEM images (ie, including both LE and recombined images) were calculated and compared using the McNemar test. Results This study included 1299 screening CEM examinations (609 female patients; mean age, 50 years ± 9 [SD]). Sixteen screen-detected cancers were diagnosed, and two interval cancers occured. Five cancers were depicted at LE imaging and an additional 11 cancers were depicted at CEM (incremental cancer detection rate, 8.7 cancers per 1000 examinations). CEM sensitivity was 88.9% (16 of 18; 95% CI: 65.3, 98.6), which was higher than the LE examination sensitivity of 27.8% (five of 18; 95% CI: 9.7, 53.5) (P = .003). However, there was decreased CEM specificity (88.9%; 1108 of 1246; 95% CI: 87.0, 90.6) compared with LE imaging (specificity, 96.2%; 1199 of 1246; 95% CI: 95.0, 97.2) (P < .001). Compared with specificity at baseline, CEM specificity at follow-up improved to 90.7% (705 of 777; 95% CI: 88.5, 92.7; P = .01). Conclusion Compared with LE imaging, CEM showed higher sensitivity but lower specificity in female patients with extremely dense breasts, although specificity improved at follow-up. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Lobbes in this issue.",

    "abstract": "Background The potential of time-dependent diffusion MRI in imaging the progression from liver fibrosis to cirrhosis has not been established. Purpose To assess the effectiveness of time-dependent diffusion MRI in mapping the microstructure and characterizing cellular attributes during the progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and to investigate its potential in grading liver fibrosis. Materials and Methods This prospective study, performed between December 2022 and October 2023, used 60 rats to establish a liver fibrosis model by means of diethylnitrosamine administration, with five additional rats serving as control animals. Time-dependent diffusion MRI was performed with equivalent diffusion time of 5.4, 10.7, and 69.3 msec on a 3.0-T scanner. Time-dependent diffusion MRI-based microstructural parameters, including cell diameter, intracellular volume fraction (ICVF), cellularity, and extracellular diffusivity, were estimated with use of the imaging microstructural parameters using limited spectrally edited diffusion, or IMPULSED, model. The fitted microstructural parameters were validated with histopathologic measurements. Results All 60 rats developed liver fibrosis, with a noticeable decrease in cell diameter and an increase in ICVF and cellularity observed as liver fibrosis progressed. The diameter measured at pathologic examination ranged from 11.4 μm to 35.4 μm, aligning with the range of 12.4-33.4 μm observed in time-dependent diffusion MRI, which indicated a strong correlation (r = 0.84; P < .001). The quantified ICVF at pathologic examination ranged from 0.28 to 0.89 and varied from 0.23 to 0.85 at time-dependent diffusion MRI, showing a high correlation (r = 0.62; P < .001). The cellularity observed at pathologic examination increased from 0.74 to 5.85, while the cellularity measured at time-dependent diffusion MRI ranged from 0.77 to 3.70, showing a correlation (r = 0.44; P < .001). Conclusion This study revealed the changes in quantitative microstructural mapping across the spectrum from liver fibrosis to cirrhosis. Cell diameter, ICVF, and cellularity are reliable markers for liver fibrosis, with diameter and ICVF presenting good discrimination ability. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Academic Radiology Physician Financial Compensation in the United States: Trends and Distribution.",
    "abstract": "Background The overall trends in academic radiology physician compensation are not well studied. Purpose To assess recent trends in academic radiology financial compensation and distribution based on rank, gender, race/ethnicity, and geography in U.S. medical schools. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis used deidentified data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Faculty Salary Report, which collects information for full-time faculty at U.S. medical schools. Financial compensation data for full-time academic radiology faculty was collected from 2017 to 2023, stratified by rank, gender, race/ethnicity, and geography. The faculty salary report includes median, 25th, and 75th percentile compensation values for each rank, which were used to analyze trends with linear regression. Median compensation values were used to compare groups based on gender, race/ethnicity, and region. Results The AAMC Faculty Salary Report data for 2023 included responses for 5847 faculty members across all radiology departments, including 306 instructors, 2758 assistant professors, 1409 associate professors, 1004 full professors, 226 chiefs, and 144 chairs. On average, median faculty compensation increased by 2.6%-4.4% per year from 2017 to 2023, with the greatest increase (by 4.4% per year) at the instructor level and smaller increases (3.4%-2.6%) at the more senior ranks. Male faculty members were consistently compensated more than women at all ranks throughout the study period. The overall salary gap remained at 6% ($455 000 for women vs $483 000 for men) throughout the study period but increased numerically from $24 000 in 2019 to $28 000 in 2023. Black/African American faculty had a lower median compensation compared with White faculty (by 4% overall; $452 000 for Black/African American faculty vs $472 000 for White faculty) at all ranks except at professor rank. Instructor compensation in the Northeast region was substantially higher (by $278 000) than other regions, but this geographic differential did not exceed $35 000 at other ranks. Conclusion This study summarized the trends of full-time academic radiology faculty compensation and showed persistent salary inequities that should be addressed as part of a broader drive to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background GPT-4V (GPT-4 with vision, ChatGPT; OpenAI) has shown impressive performance in several medical assessments. However, few studies have assessed its performance in interpreting radiologic images. Purpose To assess and compare the accuracy of GPT-4V in assessing radiologic cases with both images and textual context to that of radiologists and residents, to assess if GPT-4V assistance improves human accuracy, and to assess and compare the accuracy of GPT-4V with that of image-only or text-only inputs. Materials and Methods Seventy-two Case of the Day questions at the RSNA 2023 Annual Meeting were curated in this observer study. Answers from GPT-4V were obtained between November 26 and December 10, 2023, with the following inputs for each question: image only, text only, and both text and images. Five radiologists and three residents also answered the questions in an \"open book\" setting. For the artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted portion, the radiologists and residents were provided with the outputs of GPT-4V. The accuracy of radiologists and residents, both with and without AI assistance, was analyzed using a mixed-effects linear model. The accuracies of GPT-4V with different input combinations were compared by using the McNemar test. P < .05 was considered to indicate a significant difference. Results The accuracy of GPT-4V was 43% (31 of 72; 95% CI: 32, 55). Radiologists and residents did not significantly outperform GPT-4V in either imaging-dependent (59% and 56% vs 39%; P = .31 and .52, respectively) or imaging-independent (76% and 63% vs 70%; both P = .99) cases. With access to GPT-4V responses, there was no evidence of improvement in the average accuracy of the readers. The accuracy obtained by GPT-4V with text-only and image-only inputs was 50% (35 of 70; 95% CI: 39, 61) and 38% (26 of 69; 95% CI: 27, 49), respectively. Conclusion The radiologists and residents did not significantly outperform GPT-4V. Assistance from GPT-4V did not help human raters. GPT-4V relied on the textual context for its outputs. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article. See also the editorial by Katz in this issue.",

    "title": "Quantifying Radiology Residents' Learning Curves in Report Writing Performance Through Report Comparison and Jaccard Similarity.",
    "abstract": "Background Report writing skills are a core competency to be acquired during residency, yet objective tools for tracking performance are lacking. Purpose To investigate whether the Jaccard index, derived from report comparison, can objectively illustrate learning curves in report writing performance throughout radiology residency. Materials and Methods Retrospective data from 246 984 radiology reports written from September 2017 to November 2022 in a tertiary care radiology department were included. Reports were scored using the Jaccard similarity coefficient (ie, a quantitative expression of the amount of edits performed; range, 0-1) of residents' draft (unsupervised initial attempt at a complete report) or preliminary reports (following joint readout with attending physicians) and faculty-reviewed final reports. Weighted mean Jaccard similarity was compared between years of experience using Welch analysis of variance with post hoc testing overall, per imaging division, and per modality. Relationships with years and quarters of resident experience were assessed using Spearman correlation. Results This study included 53 residents (mean report count, 4660 ± 3546; 1-5 years of experience). Mean Jaccard similarity of preliminary reports increased by 6% from 1st-year to 5th-year residents (0.86 ± 0.22 to 0.92 ± 0.15; P < .001). Spearman correlation demonstrated a strong relationship between residents' experience and higher report similarity when aggregated for years (rs = 0.99 [95% CI: 0.85, 1.00]; P < .001) or quarters of experience (rs = 0.90 [95% CI: 0.73, 0.96]; P < .001). For residents' draft reports, Jaccard similarity increased by 14% over the course of the 5-year residency program (0.68 ± 0.27 to 0.82 ± 0.23; P < .001). Subgroup analysis confirmed similar trends for all imaging divisions and modalities (eg, in musculoskeletal imaging, from 0.77 ± 0.31 to 0.91 ± 0.16 [P < .001]; rs = 0.98 [95% CI: 0.72, 1.00] [P < .001]). Conclusion Residents' report writing performance increases with experience. Trends can be quantified with the Jaccard index, with a 6% improvement from 1st- to 5th-year residents, indicating its effectiveness as a tool for evaluating training progress and guiding education over the course of residency. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Conventional chemical shift selective (CHESS) fat suppression may fail in distal extremity MRI due to sensitivity to field inhomogeneities. Purpose To develop a patient-specific fat-suppression method for distal extremity 3-T MRI by exploiting the spectral heterogeneity adaptive radiofrequency pulse (SHARP) technique and to compare it to fat suppression with CHESS. Materials and Methods SHARP uses the routinely acquired frequency spectrum at MRI calibration to adapt the frequency range and time-bandwidth product of the fat-suppression pulse. In this prospective study, fat suppression by SHARP was assessed by numerical simulations, phantom experiments, and imaging in 15 asymptomatic participants who underwent ankle, foot, and hand (in superman and hand-by-the-side positions) MRI using SHARP, CHESS, and reference standard (short-tau inversion recovery or Dixon) techniques. Three readers ranked the MRI scans from 1 (best) to 3 (worst) regarding fat-suppression homogeneity. The added value of SHARP was defined as the difference between the proportions of images where SHARP outranked CHESS and where CHESS outranked SHARP. Friedman, Wilcoxon signed rank, and χ2 tests were used to compare in vivo data. Results At numerical simulations, SHARP showed 0% water and 62%-70% fat suppression, whereas CHESS showed 2% water and 57% fat suppression. Phantom data demonstrated lower fat-suppression inhomogeneity indexes with Dixon (1.0%) and SHARP (2.4%) compared with CHESS (10.7%). In 15 participants (mean age, 38.5 years ± 12.8 [SD]; six female participants), mean ranking by readers of fat homogeneity in the reference technique (ankle, foot, hand in superman position, and hand-by-the-side position: 1.02, 1.02, 1.03, and 1.06, respectively) was higher than those with SHARP (1.39, 1.46, 1.50, and 1.66, respectively), which were higher than those with CHESS (1.64, 1.80, 1.61, and 1.80, respectively) (all P < .001). The added value of SHARP was highest for images in the foot (389 of 1158; 33.6%; P < .001 vs other joints), followed by the ankle (247 of 971 [25%]; P < .001 vs both hand positions), and lowest for hand-by-the-side and hand in superman positions (158 of 1223; [13%] and 133 of 1193 [11%], respectively; P = .18). Conclusion SHARP provided more homogeneous fat suppression than CHESS. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background Traditional energy-integrating detector CT has limited utility in accurately quantifying liver fat due to protocol-induced CT value shifts, but this limitation can be addressed by using photon-counting detector (PCD) CT, which allows for a standardized CT value. Purpose To develop and validate a universal CT to MRI fat conversion formula to enhance fat quantification accuracy across various PCD CT protocols relative to MRI proton density fat fraction (PDFF). Materials and Methods In this prospective study, the feasibility of fat quantification was evaluated in phantoms with various nominal fat fractions. Five hundred asymptomatic participants and 157 participants with suspected metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) were enrolled between September 2023 and March 2024. Participants were randomly assigned to six groups with different CT protocols regarding tube voltage (90, 120, or 140 kVp) and radiation dose (standard or low). Of the participants in the 120-kVp standard-dose asymptomatic group, 51% (53 of 104) were designated as the training cohort, with the rest of the asymptomatic group serving as the validation cohort. A CT to MRI fat quantification formula was derived from the training cohort to estimate the CT-derived fat fraction (CTFF). CTFF agreement with PDFF and its error were evaluated in the asymptomatic validation cohort and subcohorts stratified by tube voltage, radiation dose, and body mass index, and in the MASLD cohort. The factors influencing CTFF error were further evaluated. Results In the phantoms, CTFF showed excellent agreement with nominal fat fraction (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.98; mean bias, 0.2%). A total of 412 asymptomatic participants and 122 participants with MASLD were included. A CT to MRI fat conversion formula was derived as follows: MRI PDFF (%) = -0.58 · CT (HU) + 43.1. Across all comparisons, CTFF demonstrated excellent agreement with PDFF (mean bias values < 1%). CTFF error was not influenced by tube voltage, radiation dose, body mass index, or PDFF. Agreement between CTFF and PDFF was also found in the MASLD cohort (mean bias, -0.2%). Conclusion Standardized CT value from PCD CT showed a robust and remarkable agreement with MRI PDFF across various protocols and may serve as a precise alternative for liver fat quantification. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) can be used to quantify an extended brain metabolic profile but is confounded by changes in tissue water levels due to disease. To develop a fast absolute quantification method for metabolite concentrations combining whole-brain MRSI with echo-planar time-resolved imaging (EPTI) relaxometry in individuals with glioma and healthy individuals. In this prospective study performed from August 2022 to August 2023, using internal water as concentration reference, the MRSI-EPTI quantification method was compared with the conventional method using population-average literature relaxation values. Healthy participants and participants with mutant IDH1 gliomas underwent imaging at 3 T with a 32-channel coil. Real-time navigated adiabatic spiral three-dimensional MRSI scans were acquired in approximately 8 minutes and reconstructed with a super-resolution pipeline to obtain brain metabolic images at 2.4-mm isotropic resolution. High-spatial-resolution multiparametric EPTI was performed in 3 minutes, with 1-mm isotropic resolution, to correct the relaxation and proton density of the water reference signal. Bland-Altman analysis and the Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to compare absolute quantifications from the proposed and conventional methods. Six healthy participants (four male; mean age, 37 years ± 11 [SD]) and nine participants with glioma (six male; mean age, 41 years ± 15; one with wild-type IDH1 and eight with mutant IDH1) were included. In healthy participants, there was good agreement (+4% bias) between metabolic concentrations derived using the two methods, with a CI of plus or minus 26%. In participants with glioma, there was large disagreement between the two methods (+39% bias) and a CI of plus or minus 55%. The proposed quantification method improved tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (median values) for total N-acetyl-aspartate (EPTI: 0.541 [95% CI: 0.217, 0.910]; conventional: 0.484 [95% CI: 0.199, 0.823]), total choline (EPTI: 1.053 [95% CI: 0.681, 1.713]; conventional: 0.940 [95% CI: 0.617, 1.295]), and total creatine (EPTI: 0.745 [95% CI: 0.628, 0.909]; conventional: 0.553 [95% CI: 0.444, 0.828]) (P = .03 for all). The whole-brain MRSI-EPTI method provided fast absolute quantification of metabolic concentrations with individual-specific corrections at 2.4-mm isotropic resolution, yielding concentrations closer to the true value in disease than the conventional literature-based corrections. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background The specialization and complexity of radiology makes the automatic generation of radiologic impressions (ie, a diagnosis with differential diagnosis and management recommendations) challenging. Purpose To develop a large language model (LLM) that generates impressions based on imaging findings and to evaluate its performance in professional and linguistic dimensions. Materials and Methods Six radiologists recorded imaging examination findings from August 2 to 31, 2023, at Shanghai General Hospital and used the developed LLM before routinely writing report impressions for multiple radiologic modalities (CT, MRI, radiography, mammography) and anatomic sites (cranium and face, neck, chest, upper abdomen, lower abdomen, vessels, bone and joint, spine, breast), making necessary corrections and completing the radiologic impression. A subset was defined to investigate cases where the LLM-generated impressions differed from the final radiologist impressions by excluding identical and highly similar cases. An expert panel scored the LLM-generated impressions on a five-point Likert scale (5 = strongly agree) based on scientific terminology, coherence, specific diagnosis, differential diagnosis, management recommendations, correctness, comprehensiveness, harmlessness, and lack of bias. Results In this retrospective study, an LLM was pretrained using 20 GB of medical and general-purpose text data. The fine-tuning data set comprised 1.5 GB of data, including 800 radiology reports with paired instructions (describing the output task in natural language) and outputs. Test set 2 included data from 3988 patients (median age, 56 years [IQR, 40-68 years]; 2159 male). The median recall, precision, and F1 score of LLM-generated impressions were 0.775 (IQR, 0.56-1), 0.84 (IQR, 0.611-1), and 0.772 (IQR, 0.578-0.957), respectively, using the final impressions as the reference standard. In a subset of 1014 patients (median age, 57 years [IQR, 42-69 years]; 528 male), the overall median expert panel score for LLM-generated impressions was 5 (IQR, 5-5), ranging from 4 (IQR, 3-5) to 5 (IQR, 5-5). Conclusion The developed LLM generated radiologic impressions that were professionally and linguistically appropriate for a full spectrum of radiology examinations. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

It is a disease requiring a compartment-based, pattern-recognition approach. MRI has the benefit of global assessment of the pelvis and is effective in assessing for features of malignancy and for evaluating extrapelvic locations. Transvaginal US has the advantage of dynamic maneuvers to assess for adhesions and may achieve higher spatial resolution for assessing the depth of bowel wall invasion. T1-weighted MRI evaluation increases the specificity of diagnosis by identifying hemorrhagic components, but the presence of T1 signal hyperintensity is not essential for diagnosing DE. Endometriosis is a disease with a broad spectrum; understanding the mild through advanced manifestations, including malignancy evaluation, is within the scope and breadth of radiologists' interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Background Incidental extrapulmonary findings are commonly detected on chest CT scans and can be clinically important. Purpose To integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-based segmentation for multiple structures, coronary artery calcium (CAC), and epicardial adipose tissue with automated feature extraction methods and machine learning to detect extrapulmonary abnormalities and predict all-cause mortality (ACM) in a large multicenter cohort. Materials and Methods In this post hoc analysis, baseline chest CT scans in patients enrolled in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) from August 2002 to September 2007 were included from 33 participating sites. Per scan, 32 structures were segmented with a multistructure model. For each structure, 15 clinically interpretable radiomic features were quantified. Four general codes describing abnormalities reported by NLST radiologists were applied to identify extrapulmonary significant incidental findings on the CT scans. Death at 2-year and 10-year follow-up and the presence of extrapulmonary significant incidental findings were predicted with ensemble AI models, and individualized structure risk scores were evaluated. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the models for prediction of ACM and extrapulmonary significant incidental findings. The Pearson χ2 test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used for statistical analyses. Results A total of 24 401 participants (median age, 61 years [IQR, 57-65 years]; 14 468 male) were included. In 3880 of 24 401 participants (16%), 4283 extrapulmonary significant incidental findings were reported. During the 10-year follow-up, 3389 of 24 401 participants (14%) died. CAC had the highest feature importance for predicting the three study end points. The 10-year ACM model demonstrated the best AUC performance (0.72; per-year mortality of 2.6% above and 0.8% below the risk threshold), followed by 2-year ACM (0.71; per-year mortality of 1.13% above and 0.3% below the risk threshold) and prediction of extrapulmonary significant incidental findings (0.70; probability of occurrence of 25.4% above and 9.6% below the threshold). Conclusion A fully automated AI model indicated extrapulmonary structures at risk on chest CT scans and predicted ACM with explanations.

    "abstract": "Background Bone marrow lesions (BMLs) are a known risk factor for incident knee osteoarthritis (OA), and deep learning (DL) methods can assist in automated segmentation and risk prediction. Purpose To develop and validate a DL model for quantifying tibiofemoral BML volume on MRI scans in knees without radiographic OA and to assess the association between longitudinal BML changes and incident knee OA. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included knee MRI scans from the Osteoarthritis Initiative prospective cohort (February 2004-October 2015). The DL model, developed between August and October 2023, segmented the tibiofemoral joint into 10 subregions and measured BML volume in each subregion. Baseline and 4-year follow-up MRI scans were analyzed. Knees without OA at baseline were categorized into three groups based on 4-year BML volume changes: BML-free, BML regression, and BML progression. The risk of developing radiographic and symptomatic OA over 9 years was compared among these groups. Results Included were 3869 non-OA knees in 2430 participants (mean age, 59.5 years ± 9.0 [SD]; female-to-male ratio, 1.3:1). At 4-year follow-up, 2216 knees remained BML-free, 1106 showed an increase in BML volume, and 547 showed a decrease in BML volume. BML progression was associated with a higher risk of developing radiographic knee OA compared with remaining BML-free (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.0; P < .001) or BML regression (HR = 2.0; P < .001). Knees with BML progression also had a higher risk of developing symptomatic OA compared with BML-free knees (HR = 1.3; P < .001). Larger volume changes in BML progression were associated with a higher risk of developing both radiographic OA (HR = 2.0; P < .001) and symptomatic OA (HR = 1.7; P < .001). In almost all subchondral plates, especially the medial femur and tibia, BML progression was associated with a higher risk of developing both radiographic and symptomatic OA compared with remaining BML-free. Conclusion Knees with BML progression, according to subregion and extent of volume changes, were associated with an increased risk of OA compared with BML-free knees and knees with BML regression, highlighting the potential utility of monitoring BML volume changes in evaluating interventions to prevent OA development.

    "title": "Breast Cancers Detected during a Decade of Screening with Digital Breast Tomosynthesis: Comparison with Digital Mammography.",
    "abstract": "Background Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has been shown to help increase cancer detection compared with two-dimensional digital mammography (DM). However, it is unclear whether additional tumor detection will improve outcomes or lead to overdiagnosis of breast cancer. Purpose This study aimed to compare cancer types and stages over 3 years of DM screening and 10 years of DBT screening to determine the effect of DBT. Materials and Methods A retrospective search identified breast cancers detected by using screening mammography from August 2008 through July 2021. Data collected included demographic, imaging, and pathologic information. Invasive cancers 2 cm or larger, human epidermal growth factor 2-positive or triple-negative tumors greater than 10 mm, axillary nodes positive for cancer, and distant organ spread were considered advanced cancers. The DBT and DM cohorts were compared and further analyzed by prevalent versus incident examinations. False-negative findings were also assessed. Results A total of 1407 breast cancers were analyzed (142 with DM, 1265 with DBT). DBT showed a higher rate of cancer depiction than DM (5.3 vs four cancers per 1000, respectively; P = .001), with a similar ratio of invasive cancers to ductal carcinomas in situ (76.5%:23.5% [968 and 297 of 1265, respectively] vs 71.1%:28.9% [101 and 41 of 142, respectively]). Mean invasive cancer size did not differ between DM and DBT (1.44 cm ± 0.93 [SD] vs 1.36 cm ± 1.14, respectively; P = .49), but incident DBT cases were smaller than prevalent cases (1.2 cm ± 1.0 vs 1.6 cm ± 1.4, respectively; P < .001). DBT and DM had similar rates of invasive cancer subtypes: low grade (26.5% [243 of 912] vs 29% [28 of 96], respectively), moderate grade (57.2% [522 of 912] vs 51% [49 of 96], respectively), and high grade (16.1% [147 of 912] vs 20% [19 of 96], respectively) (P = .65). The proportion of advanced cancers was lower with DBT than DM (32.6% [316 of 968] vs 43.6% [44 of 101], respectively; P = .04) and between DBT prevalent and incident screening (39.1% [133 of 340] vs 29.1% [183 of 628], respectively; P = .003). There was no difference in interval cancer rates (0.14 per 1000 with DM and 0.2 per 1000 with DBT; P = .42) for both groups. Conclusion DBT helped to increase breast cancer detection rate and depicted invasive cancers with a lower rate of advanced cancers compared with DM, with further improvement observed at incident rounds of screening. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Kim and Woo in this issue.",

    "abstract": "Background Radially sampled averaged magnetization inversion-recovery acquisition (rAMIRA) imaging shows hyperintensity in the lateral corticospinal tract (CST) in patients with motor neuron diseases. Purpose To systematically determine the accuracy of the lateral corticospinal tract sign for detecting patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at rAMIRA MRI. Materials and Methods This study included prospectively acquired data from participants in ALS and other motor neuron disease imaging studies at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. All participants underwent 3-T axial two-dimensional rAMIRA imaging at four cervical intervertebral disk levels. The lateral CST sign was defined as spinal cord white matter hyperintensity dorsolateral to the anterior horns, with higher signal intensity than in the dorsal columns on axial rAMIRA images. Marker accuracy was assessed in a study data set and in an independent validation data set. Postmortem rAMIRA imaging and histopathologic analysis were performed in one participant who died during the study. Results Participants with ALS (study data set: 38 participants [mean age, 61 years; IQR, 15 years], 22 male participants; validation data set: 10 participants [mean age, 61 years; IQR, 21 years], seven male participants), post-polio syndrome (study data set: 25 participants [mean age, 68 years; IQR, 8 years], 12 male participants), spinal muscular atrophy (study data set: 10 participants [mean age, 43 years; IQR, 14 years], eight male participants; validation data set: five participants [mean age, 38 years; IQR, 19 years], two male participants), and healthy control participants (study data set: 60 participants [mean age, 57 years; IQR, 20 years], 36 male participants; validation data set: 10 participants [mean age, 44 years; IQR, 17 years], seven male participants) were included. The sensitivity and specificity of rAMIRA for ALS were 60% (23 of 38) and 97% (91 of 94) in the study data set and 100% (10 of 10) and 93% (14 of 15) in the validation data set, respectively. Histopathologic analysis showed distinct loss of myelinated axons in the localization of the hyperintensities observed at rAMIRA imaging performed in situ and after organ extraction. Conclusion The recently defined marker at rAMIRA MRI may be a promising tool for assessing upper motor neuron degeneration in the lateral CST in patients with ALS. Clinical trials registration no.

    "abstract": "Background US shear-wave elastography (SWE) and vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) enable assessment of liver stiffness, an indicator of fibrosis severity. However, limited reproducibility data restrict their use in clinical trials. Purpose To estimate SWE and VCTE measurement variability in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) within and across systems to support clinical trial diagnostic enrichment and clinical interpretation of longitudinal liver stiffness. Materials and Methods This prospective, observational, cross-sectional study (March 2021 to November 2021) enrolled adults with NAFLD, stratified according to the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index (≤1.3, >1.3 and <2.67, ≥2.67), at two sites to assess SWE with five US systems and VCTE with one system. Each participant underwent 12 elastography examinations over two separate days within 1 week, with each day's examinations conducted by a different operator. VCTE and SWE measurements were reported in units of meters per second. The primary end point was the different-day, different-operator reproducibility coefficient (RDCDDDO) pooled across systems for SWE and individually for VCTE. Secondary end points included system-specific RDCDDDO, same-day, same-operator repeatability coefficient (RCSDSO), and between-system same-day, same-operator reproducibility coefficient. The planned sample provided 80% power to detect a pooled RDCDDDO of less than 35%, the prespecified performance threshold. Results A total of 40 participants (mean age, 60 years ± 10 [SD]; 24 women) with low (n = 17), intermediate (n = 15), and high (n = 8) FIB-4 scores were enrolled. RDCDDDO was 30.7% (95% upper bound, 34.4%) for SWE and 35.6% (95% upper bound, 43.9%) for VCTE. SWE system-specific RDCDDDO varied from 24.2% to 34.3%. The RCSDSO was 21.0% for SWE (range, 13.9%-35.0%) and 19.6% for VCTE. The SWE between-system same-day, same-operator reproducibility coefficient was 52.7%. Conclusion SWE met the prespecified threshold, RDCDDDO less than 35%, with VCTE having a higher RDCDDDO. SWE variability was higher between different systems. These estimates advance liver US-based noninvasive test qualification by (a) defining expected variability, (b) establishing that serial examination variability is lower when performed with the same system, and (c) informing clinical trial design.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical imaging tasks, such as classification or segmentation, require large and diverse datasets of images. However, due to privacy and ethical issues, as well as data sharing infrastructure barriers, these datasets are scarce and difficult to assemble. Synthetic medical imaging data generated by AI from existing data could address this challenge by augmenting and anonymizing real imaging data. In addition, synthetic data enable new applications, including modality translation, contrast synthesis, and professional training for radiologists. However, the use of synthetic data also poses technical and ethical challenges. These challenges include ensuring the realism and diversity of the synthesized images while keeping data unidentifiable, evaluating the performance and generalizability of models trained on synthetic data, and high computational costs. Since existing regulations are not sufficient to guarantee the safe and ethical use of synthetic images, it becomes evident that updated laws and more rigorous oversight are needed. Regulatory bodies, physicians, and AI developers should collaborate to develop, maintain, and continually refine best practices for synthetic data. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge of synthetic data in medical imaging and highlights current key challenges in the field to guide future research and development.",

Purpose To assess the potential for radiation dose reduction using ULD photon-counting CT (PCT) to detect lung abnormalities in recipients of lung transplant during repeat CT follow-up. Materials and Methods Consecutive adult recipients of lung transplant undergoing same-day standard-of-care low-dose (LD) and ULD PCT from March 2023 to May 2023 were prospectively included. The ULD protocols were performed with two target effective doses comprising 20% (hereafter, ULD1) and 10% (hereafter, ULD2) of the standard LD protocol. The 1-mm reconstructions were reviewed by three readers. Subjective image quality, the visibility of certain anatomic structures (using a five-point Likert scale), and the presence of lung abnormalities were independently assessed. The χ2 or t tests were used to evaluate differences between the ULD1 and ULD2 protocols. Results A total of 82 participants (median age, 64 years [IQR, 54-69 years]; 47 male) were included (41 participants for each ULD protocol). The mean effective doses per protocol were 1.41 mSv ± 0.44 (SD) for LD, 0.26 mSv ± 0.08 for ULD1, and 0.17 mSv ± 0.04 for ULD2. According to three readers, the subjective image quality of the ULD images was deemed diagnostic (Likert score ≥3) in 39-40 (ULD1) and 40-41 (ULD2) participants, and anatomic structures could be adequately visualized (Likert score ≥3) in 33-41 (ULD1) and 34-41 (ULD2) participants. The detection accuracy for individual lung anomalies exceeded 70% for both ULD protocols, except for readers 1 and 3 detecting proximal bronchiectasis and reader 3 detecting bronchial wall thickening and air trapping. No evidence of a statistically significant difference in noise (P = .96), signal-to-noise ratio (P = .77), or reader accuracy (all P ≥ .05) was noted between the ULD protocols. Conclusion ULD PCT was feasible for detecting lung abnormalities following lung transplant, with a tenfold radiation dose reduction. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background There are insufficient data comparing resorbable microspheres (RMs) with permanent trisacryl gelatin microspheres (TAGMs) for uterine artery embolization (UAE). Purpose To compare therapeutic efficacy and clinical outcomes in participants with symptomatic fibroids after UAE with RMs or TAGMs. Materials and Methods This randomized controlled trial included participants undergoing UAE for symptomatic fibroids at a single institution (from May 2021 to May 2023). Participants were randomized one-to-one to undergo UAE with either RMs or TAGMs. Numeric rating scale pain scores and cumulative fentanyl consumption were assessed for 24 hours after undergoing UAE. Anti-Mullerian hormone was measured to assess effects of UAE on ovarian function. MRI was performed before and 3 months after UAE to evaluate fibroid necrosis and uterine artery recanalization. Repeated variables such as pain were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test with post hoc Bonferroni correction. Results Sixty female participants (mean age, 45.7 years ± 3.6 [SD]) completed the study, with 30 in each group. No evidence of a difference in pain scores was observed between groups (P > .99). Moreover, there was no evidence of a difference in the total fentanyl consumption at 24 hours after UAE between groups (median: RMs, 423 [IQR, 330-530] vs TAGMs, 562 [IQR, 437-780]; P = .15). Serum anti-Mullerian hormone 3 months after UAE showed no evidence of a difference between groups (RMs vs TAGMs, 0.71 ng/mL ± 0.73 vs 0.49 ng/mL ± 0.45, respectively; P = .09). No evidence of a difference in the rate of complete necrosis of the dominant fibroid was observed between groups (97% [29 of 30] for both groups; P > .99). The rate of uterine artery recanalization was higher in RM versus TAGM groups (70% [21 of 30] vs 17% [five of 30], respectively; P < .001).

    "title": "Development and Validation of a Contrast-Enhanced US VI-RADS for Evaluating Muscle Invasion in Bladder Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Background Contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) can be used preoperatively for evaluating muscle invasion in bladder cancer, which is important for determining appropriate treatment. However, diagnostic criteria for assessing this at CEUS have not been standardized. Purpose To develop and validate a CEUS Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) for evaluating muscle invasion in bladder cancer. Materials and Methods This single-center prospective study consecutively enrolled patients with suspected bladder cancer. Participants underwent transabdominal or intracavity CEUS between July 2021 and May 2023. Participants were divided into a training set and a validation set at a 2:1 ratio based on the chronologic order of enrollment. The training set was used to identify major imaging features to include in CEUS VI-RADS, and the likelihood of muscle invasion per category was determined using a pathologic reference standard. The optimal VI-RADS category cutoff for muscle invasion was determined with use of the maximum Youden index. The validation set was assessed by novice and expert readers and used to validate the diagnostic performance and interreader agreement of the developed system. Results Overall, 126 participants (median age, 64 years [IQR, 57-71 years]; 107 male) and 67 participants (median age, 64 years [IQR, 56-69 years]; 49 male) were included in the training and validation set, respectively. In the training set, the optimal CEUS VI-RADS category cutoff for muscle invasion was VI-RADS 4 or higher (Youden index, 0.77). In the validation set, CEUS VI-RADS achieved good performance for both novice and expert readers (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.80 [95% CI: 0.70, 0.90] vs 0.88 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.97]; P = .09). The interreader agreement regarding the evaluation of CEUS VI-RADS category was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.85) for novice readers, 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.92) for expert readers, and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.84) for all readers. Conclusion The developed CEUS VI-RADS showed good performance and interreader agreement for the assessment of muscle invasion in bladder cancer. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry no.

    "title": "Combining Radiomics and Autoencoders to Distinguish Benign and Malignant Breast Tumors on US Images.",
    "abstract": "Background US is clinically established for breast imaging, but its diagnostic performance depends on operator experience. Computer-assisted (real-time) image analysis may help in overcoming this limitation. Purpose To develop precise real-time-capable US-based breast tumor categorization by combining classic radiomics and autoencoder-based features from automatically localized lesions. Materials and Methods A total of 1619 B-mode US images of breast tumors were retrospectively analyzed between April 2018 and January 2024. nnU-Net was trained for lesion segmentation. Features were extracted from tumor segments, bounding boxes, and whole images using either classic radiomics, autoencoder, or both. Feature selection was performed to generate radiomics signatures, which were used to train machine learning algorithms for tumor categorization. Models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity and were statistically compared with histopathologically or follow-up-confirmed diagnosis. Results The model was developed on 1191 (mean age, 61 years ± 14 [SD]) female patients and externally validated on 50 (mean age, 55 years ± 15]). The development data set was divided into two parts: testing and training lesion segmentation (419 and 179 examinations) and lesion categorization (503 and 90 examinations). nnU-Net demonstrated precision and reproducibility in lesion segmentation in test set of data set 1 (median Dice score [DS]: 0.90 [IQR, 0.84-0.93]; P = .01) and data set 2 (median DS: 0.89 [IQR, 0.80-0.92]; P = .001). The best model, trained with 23 mixed features from tumor bounding boxes, achieved an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.97), sensitivity of 81% (46 of 57; 95% CI: 70, 91), and specificity of 87% (39 of 45; 95% CI: 77, 87). No evidence of difference was found between model and human readers (AUC = 0.90 [95% CI: 0.83, 0.97] vs 0.83 [95% CI: 0.76, 0.90]; P = .55 and 0.90 vs 0.82 [95% CI: 0.75, 0.90]; P = .45) in tumor classification or between model and histopathologically or follow-up-confirmed diagnosis (AUC = 0.90 [95% CI: 0.83, 0.97] vs 1.00 [95% CI: 1.00,1.00]; P = .10). Conclusion Precise real-time US-based breast tumor categorization was developed by mixing classic radiomics and autoencoder-based features from tumor bounding boxes.

    "abstract": "Background Histotripsy is a nonthermal, nonionizing, noninvasive, focused US technique that relies on cavitation for mechanical tissue breakdown at the focal point. Preclinical data have shown its safety and technical success in the ablation of liver tumors. Purpose To evaluate the safety and technical success of histotripsy in destroying primary or metastatic liver tumors. Materials and Methods The parallel United States and European Union and England #HOPE4LIVER trials were prospective, multicenter, single-arm studies. Eligible patients were recruited at 14 sites in Europe and the United States from January 2021 to July 2022. Up to three tumors smaller than 3 cm in size could be treated. CT or MRI and clinic visits were performed at 1 week or less preprocedure, at index-procedure, 36 hours or less postprocedure, and 30 days postprocedure. There were co-primary end points of technical success of tumor treatment and absence of procedure-related major complications within 30 days, with performance goals of greater than 70% and less than 25%, respectively. A two-sided 95% Wilson score CI was derived for each end point. Results Forty-four participants (21 from the United States, 23 from the European Union or England; 22 female participants, 22 male participants; mean age, 64 years ± 12 [SD]) with 49 tumors were enrolled and treated. Eighteen participants (41%) had hepatocellular carcinoma and 26 (59%) had non-hepatocellular carcinoma liver metastases. The maximum pretreatment tumor diameter was 1.5 cm ± 0.6 and the maximum post-histotripsy treatment zone diameter was 3.6 cm ± 1.4. Technical success was observed in 42 of 44 treated tumors (95%; 95% CI: 84, 100) and procedure-related major complications were reported in three of 44 participants (7%; 95% CI: 2, 18), both meeting the performance goal. Conclusion The #HOPE4LIVER trials met the co-primary end-point performance goals for technical success and the absence of procedure-related major complications, supporting early clinical adoption.

    "abstract": "Background Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (NACI) has significantly increased the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), although predictors of response to this regimen have not been identified. Purpose To investigate pretreatment perfusion MRI-based radiomics as a predictive marker for pCR in patients with TNBC undergoing NACI. Materials and Methods This prospective study enrolled women with early-stage TNBC who underwent NACI at two different centers from August 2021 to July 2023. Pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scans obtained using scanners from multiple vendors were analyzed using the Tofts model to segment tumors and analyze pharmacokinetic parameters. Radiomics features were extracted from the rate constant for contrast agent plasma-to-interstitial transfer (or Ktrans), volume fraction of extravascular and extracellular space (Ve), and maximum contrast agent uptake rate (Slopemax) maps and analyzed using unsupervised correlation and least absolute shrinkage and selector operator, or LASSO, to develop a radiomics score. Score effectiveness was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and multivariable logistic regression was used to develop a multimodal nomogram for enhanced prediction. The discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility of the nomogram were evaluated in an external test set. Results The training set included 112 female participants from center 1 (mean age, 52 years ± 11 [SD]), and the external test set included 83 female participants from center 2 (mean age, 47 years ± 11). The radiomics score demonstrated an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.89) for predicting pCR. A nomogram incorporating the radiomics score, grade, and Ki-67 yielded an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.94) in the test set. Associations were found between higher radiomics score (>0.25) and tumor size (P < .001), washout enhancement (P = .01), androgen receptor expression (P = .009), and programmed death ligand 1 expression (P = .01), demonstrating a correlation with tumor immune environment in participants with TNBC. Conclusion A radiomics score derived from pharmacokinetic parameters at pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI exhibited good performance for predicting pCR in participants with TNBC undergoing NACI, and could potentially be used to enhance clinical decision making. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Recent advancements, including image processing capabilities, present new potential applications of large language models such as ChatGPT (OpenAI), a generative pretrained transformer, in radiology. However, baseline performance of ChatGPT in radiology-related tasks is understudied. Purpose To evaluate the performance of GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V) on radiology in-training examination questions, including those with images, to gauge the model's baseline knowledge in radiology. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, conducted between September 2023 and March 2024, the September 2023 release of GPT-4V was assessed using 386 retired questions (189 image-based and 197 text-only questions) from the American College of Radiology Diagnostic Radiology In-Training Examinations. Nine question pairs were identified as duplicates; only the first instance of each duplicate was considered in ChatGPT's assessment. A subanalysis assessed the impact of different zero-shot prompts on performance. Statistical analysis included χ2 tests of independence to ascertain whether the performance of GPT-4V varied between question types or subspecialty. The McNemar test was used to evaluate performance differences between the prompts, with Benjamin-Hochberg adjustment of the P values conducted to control the false discovery rate (FDR). A P value threshold of less than.05 denoted statistical significance. Results GPT-4V correctly answered 246 (65.3%) of the 377 unique questions, with significantly higher accuracy on text-only questions (81.5%, 159 of 195) than on image-based questions (47.8%, 87 of 182) (χ2 test, P < .001). Subanalysis revealed differences between prompts on text-based questions, where chain-of-thought prompting outperformed long instruction by 6.1% (McNemar, P = .02; FDR = 0.063), basic prompting by 6.8% (P = .009, FDR = 0.044), and the original prompting style by 8.9% (P = .001, FDR = 0.014). No differences were observed between prompts on image-based questions with P values of .27 to >.99. Conclusion While GPT-4V demonstrated a level of competence in text-based questions, it showed deficits interpreting radiologic images. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Deng in this issue.",

    "abstract": "Background MRI plays a crucial role in restaging locally advanced rectal cancer treated with total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT); however, prospective studies have not evaluated its ability to accurately select patients for nonoperative management. Purpose To evaluate the ability of restaging MRI to predict oncologic outcomes and identify imaging features associated with residual disease (RD) after TNT. Materials and Methods This was a secondary analysis of the Organ Preservation in Rectal Adenocarcinoma (OPRA) trial, which randomized participants from April 2014 to March 2020 with stages II or III rectal adenocarcinoma to undergo either induction or consolidation TNT. Participants enrolled in the OPRA trial who underwent restaging MRI were eligible for inclusion in the present study. Radiologists classified participants as having clinical complete response (cCR), near-complete clinical response (nCR), or incomplete clinical response (iCR) based on restaging MRI at a mean of 8 weeks ± 4 (SD) after treatment. Oncologic outcomes according to MRI response category were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify imaging characteristics associated with RD. Results A total of 277 participants (median age, 58 years [IQR, 17 years]; 179 male) who were randomized in the OPRA trial had restaging MRI forms completed. The median follow-up duration was 4.1 years. Participants with cCR had higher rates of organ preservation compared with those with nCR (65.3% vs 41.6%, log-rank P < .001). Five-year disease-free survival for participants with cCR, nCR, and iCR was 81.8%, 67.6%, and 49.6%, respectively (log-rank P < .001). The MRI response category also predicted overall survival (log-rank P < .001), distant recurrence-free survival (log-rank P = .005), and local regrowth (log-rank P = .02). Among the 266 participants with at least 2 years of follow-up, 129 (48.5%) had RD. At multivariable analysis, the presence of restricted diffusion (odds ratio, 2.50; 95% CI: 1.22, 5.24) and abnormal nodal morphologic features (odds ratio, 5.04; 95% CI: 1.43, 23.9) remained independently associated with RD. Conclusion The MRI response category was predictive of organ preservation and survival. Restricted diffusion and abnormal nodal morphologic features on restaging MRI scans were associated with increased likelihood of residual tumor.

    "abstract": "Background Podcasts have become an increasingly popular method of communicating information in medicine, including in radiology. However, the effect of podcasts on the reach of journal articles remains unclear. Purpose To evaluate the influence of Radiology podcasts on the performance metrics, including downloads, citations, and Altmetric Attention Score (AAS), of Radiology articles. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective study. All articles published in the print version of Radiology from January 2021 to December 2022 were reviewed; editorials and case reports were excluded. Articles featured on Radiology podcasts were included in the podcast group. Articles published within the same journal issue and category were the nonpodcast group. Downloads, Google Scholar citations, Dimensions citations, and AAS metrics were recorded. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare medians and evaluate differences between older and more recently published articles. Results The podcast group, composed of 88 articles, exhibited significantly higher median values for downloads (PG, 4521.0; nonpodcast group, 2123.0; P < .001), Google Scholar citations (podcast group, 14.5; nonpodcast group, 10.0; P = .01), Dimensions citations (podcast group, 12.0; nonpodcast group, 9.0; P = .01), and AAS (podcast group, 43.0; nonpodcast group, 10.0; P < .001) compared with the nonpodcast group of 378 articles. Within both groups, articles published in the earlier nonpodcast group (January to June 2021) had higher downloads (podcast group, P = .08; nonpodcast group, P < .001), Google Scholar citations (podcast group and nonpodcast group, P < .001), and Dimension citations (podcast group and nonpodcast group, P < .001) than articles from the later period (July to December 2022). AAS markedly increased in recent podcast articles (P = .03), but AAS for nonpodcast articles significantly decreased over time (P = .01). Conclusion Radiology articles featured on the Radiology podcast had greater median metrics, including downloads, Google Scholar citations, Dimensions citations, and AAS, compared with nonpodcast articles, suggesting that podcasts can be an effective method of disseminating and amplifying research within the field of radiology. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Chu and Nicola in this issue.",

    "title": "Automated Interstitial Lung Abnormality Probability Prediction at CT: A Stepwise Machine Learning Approach in the Boston Lung Cancer Study.",
    "abstract": "Background It is increasingly recognized that interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) detected at CT have potential clinical implications, but automated identification of ILAs has not yet been fully established. Purpose To develop and test automated ILA probability prediction models using machine learning techniques on CT images. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis of a retrospective study included CT scans from patients in the Boston Lung Cancer Study collected between February 2004 and June 2017. Visual assessment of ILAs by two radiologists and a pulmonologist served as the ground truth. Automated ILA probability prediction models were developed that used a stepwise approach involving section inference and case inference models. The section inference model produced an ILA probability for each CT section, and the case inference model integrated these probabilities to generate the case-level ILA probability. For indeterminate sections and cases, both two- and three-label methods were evaluated. For the case inference model, we tested three machine learning classifiers (support vector machine [SVM], random forest [RF], and convolutional neural network [CNN]). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results A total of 1382 CT scans (mean patient age, 67 years ± 11 [SD]; 759 women) were included. Of the 1382 CT scans, 104 (8%) were assessed as having ILA, 492 (36%) as indeterminate for ILA, and 786 (57%) as without ILA according to ground-truth labeling. The cohort was divided into a training set (n = 96; ILA, n = 48), a validation set (n = 24; ILA, n = 12), and a test set (n = 1262; ILA, n = 44). Among the models evaluated (two- and three-label section inference models; two- and three-label SVM, RF, and CNN case inference models), the model using the three-label method in the section inference model and the two-label method and RF in the case inference model achieved the highest AUC, at 0.87. Conclusion The model demonstrated substantial performance in estimating ILA probability, indicating its potential utility in clinical settings. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "A 45-year-old female patient with diffuse osteoarticular pain, particularly low back pain, was referred by a rheumatologist for an updated radiologic evaluation. The patient had experienced these symptoms for many years and was diagnosed with human leukocyte antigen B27-negative spondyloarthritis approximately 11 years prior, based on findings of bilateral erosive sacroiliitis at pelvic radiography and bone scintigraphy with technetium 99m (99mTc) methylene diphosphonate. After 3 years of treatment with a tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor (adalimumab), which was effective for pain, the patient was lost to follow-up. At the current presentation, approximately 8 years after being lost to follow-up, the patient presented with worsening low back pain. The presence of nonobstructing kidney stones on US images confounded the underlying cause of worsening pain. The patient also experienced fatigue and depressed mood. Routine blood tests revealed a normal blood cell count, creatinine level of 0.64 mg/dL (56.58 μmol/L) (normal range, 0.30-1.1 mg/dL [26.52-97.24 μmol/L]), C-reactive protein level of 1.1 mg/dL (normal, <1 mg/dL), and vitamin D level of 21 ng/mL (52.42 nmol/L) (normal range, 30-100 ng/mL [74.88-249.60 nmol/L]). Noncontrast MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine, MRI of the sacroiliac joints, and CT of the abdomen and pelvis were performed.",

    "title": "Optimal Large Language Model Characteristics to Balance Accuracy and Energy Use for Sustainable Medical Applications.",
    "abstract": "Background Large language models (LLMs) for medical applications use unknown amounts of energy, which contribute to the overall carbon footprint of the health care system. Purpose To investigate the tradeoffs between accuracy and energy use when using different LLM types and sizes for medical applications. Materials and Methods This retrospective study evaluated five different billion (B)-parameter sizes of two open-source LLMs (Meta's Llama 2, a general-purpose model, and LMSYS Org's Vicuna 1.5, a specialized fine-tuned model) using chest radiograph reports from the National Library of Medicine's Indiana University Chest X-ray Collection. Reports with missing demographic information and missing or blank files were excluded. Models were run on local compute clusters with visual computing graphic processing units. A single-task prompt explained clinical terminology and instructed each model to confirm the presence or absence of each of the 13 CheXpert disease labels. Energy use (in kilowatt-hours) was measured using an open-source tool. Accuracy was assessed with 13 CheXpert reference standard labels for diagnostic findings on chest radiographs, where overall accuracy was the mean of individual accuracies of all 13 labels. Efficiency ratios (accuracy per kilowatt-hour) were calculated for each model type and size. Results A total of 3665 chest radiograph reports were evaluated. The Vicuna 1.5 7B and 13B models had higher efficiency ratios (737.28 and 331.40, respectively) and higher overall labeling accuracy (93.83% [3438.69 of 3665 reports] and 93.65% [3432.38 of 3665 reports], respectively) than that of the Llama 2 models (7B: efficiency ratio of 13.39, accuracy of 7.91% [289.76 of 3665 reports]; 13B: efficiency ratio of 40.90, accuracy of 74.08% [2715.15 of 3665 reports]; 70B: efficiency ratio of 22.30, accuracy of 92.70% [3397.38 of 3665 reports]). Vicuna 1.5 7B had the highest efficiency ratio (737.28 vs 13.39 for Llama 2 7B). The larger Llama 2 70B model used more than seven times the energy of its 7B counterpart (4.16 kWh vs 0.59 kWh) with low overall accuracy, resulting in an efficiency ratio of only 22.30. Conclusion Smaller fine-tuned LLMs were more sustainable than larger general-purpose LLMs, using less energy without compromising accuracy, highlighting the importance of LLM selection for medical applications. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "title": "MRI Tumor Regression Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Alone without Radiation for Rectal Adenocarcinoma.",
    "abstract": "Background Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) is gaining acceptance for the management of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) in patients without negative prognostic factors. However, the value of MRI in evaluating tumor response after NCT remains unclear. Purpose To investigate the accuracy of MRI in assessing pathologic complete response in participants with LARC who underwent surgery after NCT without radiation. Materials and Methods A retrospective imaging substudy was conducted within two consecutive prospective clinical trials: the expanded phase II trial (from December 2017 to May 2021) and the COPEC trial (comparison of tumor response to two or four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone, ongoing from August 2021). All included participants received four cycles of capecitabine combined with oxaliplatin (or CAPOX) before surgery. Three radiologists who were blinded to the clinicopathologic data independently evaluated the tumor response using five methods, namely, MR tumor regression grade (MR-TRG) alone, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) alone, DWI-modified MR-TRG (DWImodMR-TRG), MRI complete response, and radiologic neoadjuvant response score. With pathologic assessment serving as the reference standard, the positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were determined to evaluate the accuracy and performance of these models. The AUCs of the models were compared using the DeLong test. Results A total of 224 participants were included, comprising 119 from the expanded phase II trial (median age, 61 years [IQR, 53-67]; 89 male) and 105 from the COPEC trial (median age, 59 years [IQR, 53-67]; 65 male). MR-TRG, DWI, DWImodMR-TRG, MRI complete response, and the radiologic neoadjuvant response score were associated with pathologic complete response. DWImodMR-TRG achieved the highest AUC of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.95), with a specificity of 89% (162 of 182) and a negative predictive value of 93% (162 of 174). Conclusion MRI-based models were accurate for determining pathologic complete response in participants with LARC following NCT. DWI improved the predictive performance of MRI-based assessment. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article. See also the editorial by Santiago and Shur in this issue.",

    "title": "A Lexicon for First-Trimester US: Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Consensus Conference Recommendations.",
    "abstract": "The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound convened a multisociety panel to develop a first-trimester US lexicon based on scientific evidence, societal guidelines, and expert consensus that would be appropriate for imagers, clinicians, and patients. Through a modified Delphi process with consensus of at least 80%, agreement was reached for preferred terms, synonyms, and terms to avoid. An intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) is defined as a pregnancy implanted in a normal location within the uterus. In contrast, an ectopic pregnancy (EP) is any pregnancy implanted in an abnormal location, whether extrauterine or intrauterine, thus categorizing cesarean scar implantations as EPs. The term pregnancy of unknown location is used in the setting of a pregnant patient without evidence of a definite or probable IUP or EP at transvaginal US. Since cardiac development is a gradual process and cardiac chambers are not fully formed in the first trimester, the term cardiac activity is recommended in lieu of 'heart motion' or 'heartbeat.' The terms 'living' and 'viable' should also be avoided in the first trimester. 'Pregnancy failure' is replaced by early pregnancy loss (EPL). When paired with various modifiers, EPL is used to describe a pregnancy in the first trimester that may or will not progress, is in the process of expulsion, or has either incompletely or completely passed. © RSNA and Elsevier, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Current terms used to describe the MRI findings for musculoskeletal infections are nonspecific and inconsistent. Purpose To develop and validate an MRI-based musculoskeletal infection classification and scoring system. Materials and Methods In this retrospective cross-sectional internal validation study, a Musculoskeletal Infection Reporting and Data System (MSKI-RADS) was designed. Adult patients with radiographs and MRI scans of suspected extremity infections with a known reference standard obtained between June 2015 and May 2019 were included. The scoring categories were as follows: 0, incomplete imaging; I, negative for infection; II, superficial soft-tissue infection; III, deeper soft-tissue infection; IV, possible osteomyelitis (OM); V, highly suggestive of OM and/or septic arthritis; VI, known OM; and NOS (not otherwise specified), nonspecific bone lesions. Interreader agreement for 20 radiologists from 13 institutions (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) and true-positive rates of MSKI-RADS were calculated and the accuracy of final diagnoses rendered by the readers was compared using generalized estimating equations for clustered data. Results Among paired radiographs and MRI scans from 208 patients (133 male, 75 female; mean age, 55 years ± 13 [SD]), 20 were category I; 34, II; 35, III; 30, IV; 35, V; 18, VI; and 36, NOS. Moderate interreader agreement was observed among the 20 readers (ICC, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.75). There was no evidence of correlation between reader experience and overall accuracy (P = .94). The highest true-positive rate was for MSKI-RADS I and NOS at 88.7% (95% CI: 84.6, 91.7). The true-positive rate was 73% (95% CI: 63, 80) for MSKI-RADS V. Overall reader accuracy using MSKI-RADS across all patients was 65% ± 5, higher than final reader diagnoses at 55% ± 7 (P < .001). Conclusion MSKI-RADS is a valid system for standardized terminology and recommended management of imaging findings of peripheral extremity infections across various musculoskeletal-fellowship-trained reader experience levels. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Accuracy of an Artificial Intelligence System for Interval Breast Cancer Detection at Screening Mammography.",
    "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can be used to identify interval breast cancers, although the localizations are not always accurate. Purpose To evaluate AI localizations of interval cancers (ICs) on screening mammograms by IC category and histopathologic characteristics. Materials and Methods A screening mammography data set (median patient age, 57 years [IQR, 52-64 years]) that had been assessed by two human readers from January 2011 to December 2018 was retrospectively analyzed using a commercial AI system. The AI outputs were lesion locations (heatmaps) and the highest per-lesion risk score (range, 0-100) assigned to each case. AI heatmaps were considered false positive (FP) if they occurred on normal screening mammograms or on IC screening mammograms (ie, in patients subsequently diagnosed with IC) but outside the cancer boundary. A panel of consultant radiology experts classified ICs as normal or benign (true negative [TN]), uncertain (minimal signs of malignancy [MS]), or suspicious (false negative [FN]). Several specificity and sensitivity thresholds were applied. Mann-Whitney U tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, and χ2 tests were used to compare groups. Results A total of 2052 screening mammograms (514 ICs and 1548 normal mammograms) were included. The median AI risk score was 50 (IQR, 32-82) for TN ICs, 76 (IQR, 41-90) for ICs with MS, and 89 (IQR, 81-95) for FN ICs (P = .005). Higher median AI scores were observed for invasive tumors (62 [IQR, 39-88]) than for noninvasive tumors (33 [IQR, 20-55]; P < .01) and for high-grade (grade 2-3) tumors (62 [IQR, 40-87]) than for low-grade (grade 0-1) tumors (45 [IQR, 26-81]; P = .02). At the 96% specificity threshold, the AI algorithm flagged 121 of 514 (23.5%) ICs and correctly localized the IC in 93 of 121 (76.9%) cases, with 48 FP heatmaps on the mammograms for ICs (rate, 0.093 per case) and 74 FP heatmaps on normal mammograms (rate, 0.048 per case). The AI algorithm correctly localized a lower proportion of TN ICs (54 of 427; 12.6%) than ICs with MS (35 of 76; 46%) and FN ICs (four of eight; 50% [95% CI: 13, 88]; P < .001). The AI algorithm localized a higher proportion of node-positive than node-negative cancers (P = .03). However, no evidence of a difference by cancer type (P = .09), grade (P = .27), or hormone receptor status (P = .12) was found. At 89.8% specificity and 79% sensitivity thresholds, AI detection increased to 181 (35.2%) and 256 (49.8%) of the 514 ICs, respectively, with FP heatmaps on 158 (10.2%) and 307 (19.8%) of the 1548 normal mammograms. Conclusion Use of a standalone AI system improved early cancer detection by correctly identifying some cancers missed by two human readers, with no differences based on histopathologic features except for node-positive cancers. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

(Stereotactic body radiation therapy was initiated 5 months after pazopanib treatment was initiated.) One month after initiating treatment with pazopanib and 6 months before the surveillance imaging, the patient developed diarrhea and required ongoing treatment with loperamide to control symptoms.

    "title": "Field-Cycling MRI for Identifying Minor Ischemic Stroke Below 0.2 T.",
    "abstract": "Background Field-cycling imaging (FCI) is a new technology developed at the University of Aberdeen that measures change in T1 relaxation time constant of tissues over a range of low magnetic field strengths (0.2-200 mT) by rapidly switching between different fields during the pulse sequence. This provides new sources of contrast, including some invisible to clinical MRI scanners, and may be a useful alternative imaging modality for stroke. Purpose To test whether a prototype whole-body FCI scanner can be used to identify infarct regions in patients with subacute ischemic stroke. Materials and Methods This prospective study screened consecutive adult patients admitted to a single center stroke unit from February 2018 to March 2020 and April to December 2021. Included participants with confirmed ischemic stroke underwent FCI 1-6 days after ictus. FCI scans were obtained at four to six evolution fields between 0.2 mT and 0.2 T, with five evolution times from 5 to 546 msec. T1 maps were generated. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare infarct region and contralateral unaffected brain, and Spearman rank correlation was used to examine associations between infarct to contralateral tissue contrast ratio and field strengths. Two independent readers blinded to clinical images rated the FCI scans. Results Nine participants (mean age, 62 years ± 16 [SD]; all male) successfully completed FCI. FCI scans below 0.2 T exhibited hyperintense T1 regions corresponding to the infarct region identified at baseline imaging, visually confirmed with 86% interrater agreement (Cohen κ = 0.69). Infarct to contralateral tissue contrast ratio increased as magnetic field decreased between 0.2 mT and 0.2 T (r[24] = -0.68; P < .001). T1 dispersion slopes differed between infarct and unaffected tissues (median, 0.23 [IQR, 0.18-0.37] vs 0.35 [IQR, 0.27-0.43]; P = .03). Conclusion Whole-brain FCI can be used to identify subacute ischemic stroke by T1 relaxation mechanisms at field strengths as low as 0.2 mT.

    "abstract": "Background Deep learning (DL) could improve the labor-intensive, challenging processes of diagnosing cerebral aneurysms but requires large multicenter data sets. Purpose To construct a DL model using a multicenter data set for accurate cerebral aneurysm segmentation and detection on CT angiography (CTA) images and to compare its performance with radiology reports. Materials and Methods Consecutive head or head and neck CTA images of suspected unruptured cerebral aneurysms were gathered retrospectively from eight hospitals between February 2018 and October 2021 for model development. An external test set with reference standard digital subtraction angiography (DSA) scans was obtained retrospectively from one of the eight hospitals between February 2022 and February 2023. Radiologists (reference standard) assessed aneurysm segmentation, while model performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The model's aneurysm detection performance was assessed by sensitivity and comparing areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) between the model and radiology reports in the DSA data set with use of the DeLong test. Results Images from 6060 patients (mean age, 56 years ± 12 [SD]; 3375 [55.7%] female) were included for model development (training: 4342; validation: 1086; and internal test set: 632). Another 118 patients (mean age, 59 years ± 14; 79 [66.9%] female) were included in an external test set to evaluate performance based on DSA. The model achieved a DSC of 0.87 for aneurysm segmentation performance in the internal test set. Using DSA, the model achieved 85.7% (108 of 126 aneurysms [95% CI: 78.1, 90.1]) sensitivity in detecting aneurysms on per-vessel analysis, with no evidence of a difference versus radiology reports (AUC, 0.93 [95% CI: 0.90, 0.95] vs 0.91 [95% CI: 0.87, 0.94]; P = .67). Model processing time from reconstruction to detection was 1.76 minutes ± 0.32 per scan. Conclusion The proposed DL model could accurately segment and detect cerebral aneurysms at CTA with no evidence of a significant difference in diagnostic performance compared with radiology reports. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Pain Experience and Image Quality with Curved versus Standard Compression for Breast Cancer Screening Mammography: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
    "abstract": "Background A curve-shaped compression paddle could reduce the pain experienced by some women at breast cancer screening. Purpose To compare curved and standard compression systems in terms of pain experience and image quality in mammography screening. Materials and Methods In this randomized controlled trial conducted between October 2021 and February 2022, participants screened at three screening sites in the Netherlands were randomized to either a curved-paddle or sham-paddle group. The sham paddle was a standard paddle that was presented as a new paddle. At a standard screening examination, one additional image was acquired with a curved or sham paddle. Pain was measured on a numerical rating scale (range, 0-10). Participants provided a pain score after compression with the standard and test paddles, resulting in two scores per participant. Differences in pain scores were compared between groups using analysis of covariance, adjusting for pain score after standard-paddle compression. Two radiographers and two radiologists performed unblinded paired comparisons of curved-paddle vs standard-paddle images, using standard image quality criteria (radiographers evaluated 1246 image pairs using 12 criteria; radiologists evaluated 320 image pairs using six criteria). The one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine if there was a significant preference for either paddle. Results In total, 2499 female participants (mean age, 61.6 years ± 7.1 [SD]) were studied; 1250 in the curved-paddle group and 1249 in the sham-paddle group. The mean pain score decreased by an additional 0.19 points in the curved-paddle group compared with the sham-paddle group (95% CI: 0.09, 0.28; P < .001). In terms of image quality, the observers showed no preference or a preference for the standard paddle. Decreased image contrast (range Bonferroni-corrected P values: P < .001 to P > .99) and visibility of structures were the main concerns for curved-paddle images. Conclusion The use of the curved paddle resulted in a minimal pain reduction during mammography breast compression but image quality was reduced. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "title": "Quantitative 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET and Clinical Outcomes in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Following 177Lu-PSMA-617 (VISION Trial).",
    "abstract": "Background Lutetium 177 [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (177Lu-PSMA-617) is a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radioligand therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Quantitative PSMA PET/CT analysis could provide information on 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment benefits. Purpose To explore the association between quantitative baseline gallium 68 [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA-11) PET/CT parameters and treatment response and outcomes in the VISION trial. Materials and Methods This was an exploratory secondary analysis of the VISION trial. Eligible participants were randomized (June 2018 to October 2019) in a 2:1 ratio to 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy (7.4 GBq every 6 weeks for up to six cycles) plus standard of care (SOC) or to SOC only. Baseline 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET parameters, including the mean and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmean and SUVmax), PSMA-positive tumor volume, and tumor load, were extracted from five anatomic regions and the whole body. Associations of quantitative PET parameters with radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate, and prostate-specific antigen response were investigated using univariable and multivariable analyses (with treatment as the only other covariate). Outcomes were assessed in subgroups based on SUVmean quartiles. Results Quantitative PET parameters were well balanced between study arms for the 826 participants included. The median whole-body tumor SUVmean was 7.6 (IQR, 5.8-9.9). Whole-body tumor SUVmean was the best predictor of 177Lu-PSMA-617 efficacy, with a hazard ratio (HR) range of 0.86-1.43 for all outcomes (all P < .001). A 1-unit whole-body tumor SUVmean increase was associated with a 12% and 10% decrease in risk of an rPFS event and death, respectively. 177Lu-PSMA-617 plus SOC prolonged rPFS and OS in all SUVmean quartiles versus SOC only, with no identifiable optimum among participants receiving 177Lu-PSMA-617. Higher baseline PSMA-positive tumor volume and tumor load were associated with worse rPFS (HR range, 1.44-1.53 [P < .05] and 1.02-1.03 [P < .001], respectively) and OS (HR range, 1.36-2.12 [P < .006] and 1.04 [P < .001], respectively). Conclusion Baseline 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT whole-body tumor SUVmean was the best predictor of 177Lu-PSMA-617 efficacy in participants in the VISION trial. Improvements in rPFS and OS with 177Lu-PSMA-617 plus SOC were greater among participants with higher whole-body tumor SUVmean, with evidence for benefit at all SUVmean levels.

    "abstract": "Background Attenuation coefficient (AC) and shear-wave speed (SWS) are established US markers for assessing patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), while shear-wave dispersion slope (DS) is not. Purpose To assess the relationship between the multiparametric US imaging markers DS, AC, and SWS and liver histopathologic necroinflammation in patients with MASLD. Materials and Methods This international multicenter prospective study enrolled consecutive patients with biopsy-proven MASLD between June 2019 and March 2023. Before biopsy, all participants underwent multiparametric US, and measurements of DS, AC, and SWS were obtained. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to assess the association of clinical variables and imaging markers with pathologic findings. The diagnostic performance of imaging markers for determining inflammation grade, steatosis grade, and fibrosis stage was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results A total of 124 participants (mean age, 53 years ± 15 [SD]; 62 males) were evaluated. In multivariable regression, lobular inflammation was associated with DS (regression coefficient, 0.06; P = .02), alanine aminotransferase level (regression coefficient, 0.002; P = .002), and Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (regression coefficient, -0.68; P = .047), while steatosis was associated with AC (regression coefficient, 3.66; P < .001) and fibrosis was associated with SWS (regression coefficient, 2.02; P < .001) and body mass index (regression coefficient, 0.05; P = .02). DS achieved an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.82) for identifying participants with inflammation grade A2 or higher (moderate to severe inflammation). AC showed excellent performance for identifying participants with grade S1 (mild) or higher steatosis (AUC, 0.92 [95% CI: 0.87, 0.97]), while SWS showed excellent performance for identifying participants with fibrosis stage F2 or higher (clinically significant fibrosis) (AUC, 0.91 [95% CI: 0.86, 0.96]). Of the three US markers, SWS showed the highest AUC (0.81 [95% CI: 0.74, 0.89]) for the diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. Conclusion Of the three US imaging markers (DS, AC, and SWS), DS was most associated with lobular inflammation grade at histologic examination and demonstrated fair diagnostic performance in distinguishing moderate to severe lobular inflammation.

    "title": "CT Myocardial Perfusion and CT-FFR versus Invasive FFR for Hemodynamic Relevance of Coronary Artery Disease.",
    "abstract": "Background CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) and dynamic CT myocardial perfusion imaging enhance the specificity of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) for ruling out coronary artery disease (CAD). However, evidence on comparative diagnostic value remains scarce. Purpose To compare the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA plus CT-FFR, CCTA plus CT perfusion, and sequential CCTA plus CT-FFR and CT perfusion for detecting hemodynamically relevant CAD with that of invasive angiography. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis of a prospective study included patients with chest pain referred for invasive coronary angiography at nine centers from July 2016 to September 2019. CCTA and CT perfusion were performed with third-generation dual-source CT scanners. CT-FFR was assessed on-site. Independent core laboratories analyzed CCTA alone, CCTA plus CT perfusion, CCTA plus CT-FFR, and a sequential approach involving CCTA plus CT-FFR and CT perfusion for the presence of hemodynamically relevant stenosis. Invasive coronary angiography with invasive fractional flow reserve was the reference standard. Diagnostic accuracy metrics and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were compared with the Sign test and DeLong test. Results Of the 105 participants (mean age, 64 years ± 8 [SD]; 68 male), 49 (47%) had hemodynamically relevant stenoses at invasive coronary angiography. CCTA plus CT-FFR and CCTA plus CT perfusion showed no evidence of a difference for participant-based sensitivities (90% vs 90%, P > .99), specificities (77% vs 79%, P > .99) and vessel-based AUCs (0.84 [95% CI: 0.77, 0.91] vs 0.83 [95% CI: 0.75, 0.91], P = .90). Both had higher participant-based specificity than CCTA alone (54%, both P < .001) without evidence of a difference in sensitivity between CCTA (94%) and CCTA plus CT perfusion (P = .50) or CCTA plus CT-FFR (P = .63). The sequential approach combining CCTA plus CT-FFR with CT perfusion achieved higher participant-based specificity than CCTA plus CT-FFR (88% vs 77%, P = .03) without evidence of a difference in participant-based sensitivity (88% vs 90%, P > .99) and vessel-based AUC (0.85 [95% CI: 0.77, 0.93], P = .78). Compared with CCTA plus CT perfusion, the sequential approach showed no evidence of a difference in participant-based sensitivity (P > .99), specificity (P = .06), or vessel-based AUC (P = .54). Conclusion There was no evidence of a difference in diagnostic accuracy between CCTA plus CT-FFR and CCTA plus CT perfusion for detecting hemodynamically relevant CAD. A sequential approach combining CCTA plus CT-FFR with CT perfusion led to improved participant-based specificity with no evidence of a difference in sensitivity compared with CCTA plus CT-FFR.

The system has both US and MRI components with separate but complementary lexicons and assessment categories to assign the risk of malignancy. US is an appropriate initial imaging modality, and O-RADS US can accurately help to characterize most adnexal lesions. MRI is a valuable adjunct imaging tool to US, and O-RADS MRI can help to both confirm a benign diagnosis and accurately stratify lesions that are at risk for malignancy. This article will review the O-RADS US and MRI systems, highlight their similarities and differences, and provide an overview of the interplay between the systems. When used together, the O-RADS US and MRI systems can help to accurately diagnose benign lesions, assess the risk of malignancy in lesions suspicious for malignancy, and triage patients for optimal management.",

    "title": "Using AI to Identify Unremarkable Chest Radiographs for Automatic Reporting.",
    "abstract": "Background Radiology practices have a high volume of unremarkable chest radiographs and artificial intelligence (AI) could possibly improve workflow by providing an automatic report. Purpose To estimate the proportion of unremarkable chest radiographs, where AI can correctly exclude pathology (ie, specificity) without increasing diagnostic errors. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, consecutive chest radiographs in unique adult patients (≥18 years of age) were obtained January 1-12, 2020, at four Danish hospitals. Exclusion criteria included insufficient radiology reports or AI output error. Two thoracic radiologists, who were blinded to AI output, labeled chest radiographs as \"remarkable\" or \"unremarkable\" based on predefined unremarkable findings (reference standard). Radiology reports were classified similarly. A commercial AI tool was adapted to output a chest radiograph \"remarkableness\" probability, which was used to calculate specificity at different AI sensitivities. Chest radiographs with missed findings by AI and/or the radiology report were graded by one thoracic radiologist as critical, clinically significant, or clinically insignificant. Paired proportions were compared using the McNemar test. Results A total of 1961 patients were included (median age, 72 years [IQR, 58-81 years]; 993 female), with one chest radiograph per patient. The reference standard labeled 1231 of 1961 chest radiographs (62.8%) as remarkable and 730 of 1961 (37.2%) as unremarkable. At 99.9%, 99.0%, and 98.0% sensitivity, the AI had a specificity of 24.5% (179 of 730 radiographs [95% CI: 21, 28]), 47.1% (344 of 730 radiographs [95% CI: 43, 51]), and 52.7% (385 of 730 radiographs [95% CI: 49, 56]), respectively. With the AI fixed to have a similar sensitivity as radiology reports (87.2%), the missed findings of AI and reports had 2.2% (27 of 1231 radiographs) and 1.1% (14 of 1231 radiographs) classified as critical (P = .01), 4.1% (51 of 1231 radiographs) and 3.6% (44 of 1231 radiographs) classified as clinically significant (P = .46), and 6.5% (80 of 1231) and 8.1% (100 of 1231) classified as clinically insignificant (P = .11), respectively. At sensitivities greater than or equal to 95.4%, the AI tool exhibited less than or equal to 1.1% critical misses. Conclusion A commercial AI tool used off-label could correctly exclude pathology in 24.5%-52.7% of all unremarkable chest radiographs at greater than or equal to 98% sensitivity. The AI had equal or lower rates of critical misses than radiology reports at sensitivities greater than or equal to 95.4%. These results should be confirmed in a prospective study. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article. See also the editorial by Yoon and Hwang in this issue.",

    "abstract": "Background Quantifying the fibrotic and calcific composition of the aortic valve at CT angiography (CTA) can be useful for assessing disease severity and outcomes of patients with aortic stenosis (AS); however, it has not yet been validated against quantitative histologic findings. Purpose To compare quantification of aortic valve fibrotic and calcific tissue composition at CTA versus histologic examination. Materials and Methods This prospective study included patients who underwent CTA before either surgical aortic valve replacement for AS or orthotopic heart transplant (controls) at two centers between January 2022 and April 2023. At CTA, fibrotic and calcific tissue composition were quantified using automated Gaussian mixture modeling applied to the density of aortic valve tissue components, calculated as [(volume/total tissue volume) × 100]. For histologic evaluation, explanted valve cusps were stained with Movat pentachrome as well as hematoxylin and eosin. For each cusp, three 5-µm slices were obtained. Fibrotic and calcific tissue composition were quantified using a validated artificial intelligence tool and averaged across the aortic valve. Correlations were assessed using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Intermodality and interobserver variability were measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. Results Twenty-nine participants (mean age, 63 years ± 10 [SD]; 23 male) were evaluated: 19 with severe AS, five with moderate AS, and five controls. Fibrocalcific tissue composition strongly correlated with histologic findings (r = 0.92; P < .001). The agreement between CTA and histologic findings for fibrocalcific tissue quantification was excellent (ICC, 0.94; P = .001), with underestimation of fibrotic composition at CTA (bias, -4.9%; 95% limits of agreement [LoA]: -18.5%, 8.7%). Finally, there was excellent interobserver repeatability for fibrotic (ICC, 0.99) and calcific (ICC, 0.99) aortic valve tissue volume measurements, with no evidence of a difference in measurements between readers (bias, -0.04 cm3 [95% LoA: -0.27 cm3, 0.19 cm3] and 0.02 cm3 [95% LoA: -0.14 cm3, 0.19 cm3], respectively). Conclusion In a direct comparison, standardized quantitative aortic valve tissue characterization at CTA showed excellent concordance with histologic findings and demonstrated interobserver reproducibility.

    "abstract": "Background A watch-and-wait regimen for locally advanced rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy (NCRT) relies on identifying complete tumor response. However, the concordance between a complete response at combined T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI (T2DWI) and pathologic complete response (pCR; ie, ypT0N0) in the tumor is unsatisfactory. Purpose To assess whether identification of mucosal linear enhancement (MLE) at arterial-phase contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted MRI is associated with ypT0 status in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after NCRT and to evaluate whether combining MLE at CE T1-weighted MRI and negative lymph node metastasis (LNM) at T2DWI can improve identification of pCR. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent total mesorectal excision after NCRT between July 2020 and July 2023 at a tertiary referral academic center. Restaging MRI included T2DWI and arterial-phase CE T1-weighted MRI for primary tumor assessment and T2DWI for evaluation of LNM status. Imaging features associated with ypT0 status were identified at multivariable regression analysis. Results In total, 239 patients (mean age, 58 years ± 12 [SD]; 180 male patients) were assessed. MLE was more common in the ypT0 group than in the ypT1-4 group after NCRT (73% vs 4%, respectively; P < .001). MLE was associated with higher odds of ypT0 status in an adjusted analysis (odds ratio, 137; 95% CI: 25, 767; P < .001). The combination of MLE and negative LNM status achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.88) for pCR. Conclusion MLE at CE MRI was associated with higher odds of complete tumor response. Combining MLE and negative LNM status showed good performance for identifying complete tumor response and may exclude residual tumors after NCRT in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Distribution of Solid Lung Nodules Presence and Size by Age and Sex in a Northern European Nonsmoking Population.",
    "abstract": "Background Most of the data regarding prevalence and size distribution of solid lung nodules originates from lung cancer screening studies that target high-risk populations or from Asian general cohorts. In recent years, the identification of lung nodules in non-high-risk populations, scanned for clinical indications, has increased. However, little is known about the presence of solid lung nodules in the Northern European nonsmoking population. Purpose To study the prevalence and size distribution of solid lung nodules by age and sex in a nonsmoking population. Materials and Methods Participants included nonsmokers (never or former smokers) from the population-based Imaging in Lifelines study conducted in the Northern Netherlands. Participants (age ≥ 45 years) with completed lung function tests underwent chest low-dose CT scans. Seven trained readers registered the presence and size of solid lung nodules measuring 30 mm3 or greater using semiautomated software. The prevalence and size of lung nodules (≥30 mm3), clinically relevant lung nodules (≥100 mm3), and actionable nodules (≥300 mm3) are presented by 5-year categories and by sex. Results A total of 10 431 participants (median age, 60.4 years [IQR, 53.8-70.8 years]; 56.6% [n = 5908] female participants; 46.1% [n = 4812] never smokers and 53.9% [n = 5619] former smokers) were included. Of these, 42.0% (n = 4377) had at least one lung nodule (male participants, 47.5% [2149 of 4523]; female participants, 37.7% [2228 of 5908]). The prevalence of lung nodules increased from age 45-49.9 years (male participants, 39.4% [219 of 556]; female participants, 27.7% [236 of 851]) to age 80 years or older (male participants, 60.7% [246 of 405]; female participants, 50.9% [163 of 320]). Clinically relevant lung nodules were present in 11.1% (1155 of 10 431) of participants, with prevalence increasing with age (male participants, 8.5%-24.4%; female participants, 3.7%-15.6%), whereas actionable nodules were present in 1.1%-6.4% of male participants and 0.6%-4.9% of female participants. Conclusion Lung nodules were present in a substantial proportion of all age groups in the Northern European nonsmoking population, with slightly higher prevalence for male participants than female participants. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "title": "Update on PI-RADS Version 2.1 Diagnostic Performance Benchmarks for Prostate MRI: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Background Prostate MRI for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) is standardized by the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS), currently in version 2.1. A systematic review and meta-analysis infrastructure with a 12-month update cycle was established to evaluate the diagnostic performance of PI-RADS over time. Purpose To provide estimates of diagnostic accuracy and cancer detection rates (CDRs) of PI-RADS version 2.1 categories for prostate MRI, which is required for further evidence-based patient management. Materials and Methods A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and multiple trial registers (English-language studies published from March 1, 2019, to August 30, 2022) was performed. Studies that reported data on diagnostic accuracy or CDRs of PI-RADS version 2.1 with csPCa as the primary outcome were included. For the meta-analysis, pooled estimates for sensitivity, specificity, and CDRs were derived from extracted data at the lesion level and patient level. Sensitivity and specificity for PI-RADS greater than or equal to 3 and PI-RADS greater than or equal to 4 considered as test positive were investigated. In addition to individual PI-RADS categories 1-5, subgroup analyses of subcategories (ie, 2+1, 3+0) were performed. Results A total of 70 studies (11 686 lesions, 13 330 patients) were included. At the patient level, with PI-RADS greater than or equal to 3 considered positive, meta-analysis found a 96% summary sensitivity (95% CI: 95, 98) and 43% specificity (95% CI: 33, 54), with an area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.93). For PI-RADS greater than or equal to 4, meta-analysis found an 89% sensitivity (95% CI: 85, 92) and 66% specificity (95% CI: 58, 74), with an area under the SROC curve of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.92). CDRs were as follows: PI-RADS 1, 6%; PI-RADS 2, 5%; PI-RADS 3, 19%; PI-RADS 4, 54%; and PI-RADS 5, 84%. The CDR was 12% (95% CI: 7, 19) for transition zone 2+1 lesions and 19% (95% CI: 12, 29) for 3+0 lesions (P = .12). Conclusion Estimates of diagnostic accuracy and CDRs for PI-RADS version 2.1 categories are provided for quality benchmarking and to guide further evidence-based patient management. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Intravenous prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radioligand therapy improves survival in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Yet, the impact of selective prostatic arterial administration on primary tumor uptake is unclear. Purpose To compare gallium 68 (68Ga)-PSMA-11 uptake using dynamic PET/CT in prostatic tumoral volumes of interest (VOIs) during intravenous and selective prostatic arterial infusions for individuals with untreated, high-risk prostate cancer. Materials and Methods In this prospective, intraindividual comparative study conducted at an academic medical center, five men aged 58, 61, 64, 66, and 68 years with treatment-naive prostate cancer were enrolled between January 2022 and February 2023 and underwent two dynamic 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT examinations 1 week apart. During the first examination, the radiotracer was administered intravenously. During the second administration, the radiotracer was delivered into either the right or left prostatic artery through an angiographically placed microcatheter. The primary outcome was maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in prostatic tumoral VOIs. The secondary outcomes included mean SUV (SUVmean) in prostatic tumoral VOIs and area under the SUVmean curves (AUC). Longitudinal mixed-effects models were used to compare dynamic SUVmax and SUVmean time-activity curves (TACs), and paired t tests were used for the remaining data. Results The mean SUVmax within tumoral VOIs was 14 (range, 3-43) for venous sessions and 938 (range, 460-1436) for arterial sessions (P = .008). The SUVmean within VOIs was greater during arterial sessions (P < .001) overall and 46-fold and 19-fold greater at peak uptake and final time points, respectively. The mean AUC was greater on arterial TACs than on venous TACs at 14600 SUV × min (range, 8353-20025 SUV × min) and 240 SUV × min (range, 69-622 SUV × min), respectively (P = .002). Conclusion Selective prostatic arterial infusion resulted in greater 68Ga-PSMA-11 tumoral SUV than intravenous infusion. Further study of local-regional, intra-arterial delivery of a PSMA-targeted theranostic agent is warranted in high-risk prostate cancer.

    "abstract": "Background It is unclear whether breast US screening outcomes for women with dense breasts vary with levels of breast cancer risk. Purpose To evaluate US screening outcomes for female patients with dense breasts and different estimated breast cancer risk levels. Materials and Methods This retrospective observational study used data from US screening examinations in female patients with heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts conducted from January 2014 to October 2020 at 24 radiology facilities within three Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) registries. The primary outcomes were the cancer detection rate, false-positive biopsy recommendation rate, and positive predictive value of biopsies performed (PPV3). Risk classification of participants was performed using established BCSC risk prediction models of estimated 6-year advanced breast cancer risk and 5-year invasive breast cancer risk. Differences in high- versus low- or average-risk categories were assessed using a generalized linear model. Results In total, 34 791 US screening examinations from 26 489 female patients (mean age at screening, 53.9 years ± 9.0 [SD]) were included. The overall cancer detection rate per 1000 examinations was 2.0 (95% CI: 1.6, 2.4) and was higher in patients with high versus low or average risk of 6-year advanced breast cancer (5.5 [95% CI: 3.5, 8.6] vs 1.3 [95% CI: 1.0, 1.8], respectively; P = .003). The overall false-positive biopsy recommendation rate per 1000 examinations was 29.6 (95% CI: 22.6, 38.6) and was higher in patients with high versus low or average 6-year advanced breast cancer risk (37.0 [95% CI: 28.2, 48.4] vs 28.1 [95% CI: 20.9, 37.8], respectively; P = .04). The overall PPV3 was 6.9% (67 of 975; 95% CI: 5.3, 8.9) and was higher in patients with high versus low or average 6-year advanced cancer risk (15.0% [15 of 100; 95% CI: 9.9, 22.2] vs 4.9% [30 of 615; 95% CI: 3.3, 7.2]; P = .01). Similar patterns in outcomes were observed by 5-year invasive breast cancer risk. Conclusion The cancer detection rate and PPV3 of supplemental US screening increased with the estimated risk of advanced and invasive breast cancer. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background The combination of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with mechanical thrombectomy (MT) may have clinical benefits for patients with medium vessel occlusion. Purpose To examine whether MT combined with IVT is associated with different outcomes than MT alone in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and medium vessel occlusion. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive adult patients with AIS and medium vessel occlusion treated with MT or MT with IVT at 37 academic centers in North America, Asia, and Europe. Data were collected from September 2017 to July 2021. Propensity score matching was performed to reduce confounding. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to test the association between the addition of IVT treatment and different functional and safety outcomes. Results After propensity score matching, 670 patients (median age, 75 years [IQR, 64-82 years]; 356 female) were included in the analysis; 335 underwent MT alone and 335 underwent MT with IVT. Median onset to puncture (350 vs 210 minutes, P < .001) and onset to recanalization (397 vs 273 minutes, P < .001) times were higher in the MT group than the MT with IVT group, respectively. In the univariable regression analysis, the addition of IVT was associated with higher odds of a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2 (odds ratio [OR], 1.44; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.96; P = .019); however, this association was not observed in the multivariable analysis (OR, 1.37; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.89; P = .054). In the multivariable analysis, the addition of IVT also showed no evidence of an association with the odds of first-pass effect (OR, 1.27; 95% CI: 0.9, 1.79; P = .17), Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grades 2b-3 (OR, 1.64; 95% CI: 0.99, 2.73; P = .055), mRS scores 0-1 (OR, 1.27; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.76; P = .16), mortality (OR, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.24; P = .29), or intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 1.25; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.76; P = .21). Conclusion Adjunctive IVT may not provide benefit to MT in patients with AIS caused by distal and medium vessel occlusion. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Multiparametric MRI can help identify clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) (Gleason score ≥7) but is limited by reader experience and interobserver variability. In contrast, deep learning (DL) produces deterministic outputs. Purpose To develop a DL model to predict the presence of csPCa by using patient-level labels without information about tumor location and to compare its performance with that of radiologists. Materials and Methods Data from patients without known csPCa who underwent MRI from January 2017 to December 2019 at one of multiple sites of a single academic institution were retrospectively reviewed. A convolutional neural network was trained to predict csPCa from T2-weighted images, diffusion-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient maps, and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced images. The reference standard was pathologic diagnosis. Radiologist performance was evaluated as follows: Radiology reports were used for the internal test set, and four radiologists' PI-RADS ratings were used for the external (ProstateX) test set. The performance was compared using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and the DeLong test. Gradient-weighted class activation maps (Grad-CAMs) were used to show tumor localization. Results Among 5735 examinations in 5215 patients (mean age, 66 years ± 8 [SD]; all male), 1514 examinations (1454 patients) showed csPCa. In the internal test set (400 examinations), the AUC was 0.89 and 0.89 for the DL classifier and radiologists, respectively (P = .88). In the external test set (204 examinations), the AUC was 0.86 and 0.84 for the DL classifier and radiologists, respectively (P = .68). DL classifier plus radiologists had an AUC of 0.89 (P < .001). Grad-CAMs demonstrated activation over the csPCa lesion in 35 of 38 and 56 of 58 true-positive examinations in internal and external test sets, respectively. Conclusion The performance of a DL model was not different from that of radiologists in the detection of csPCa at MRI, and Grad-CAMs localized the tumor. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

However, the predictive ability of individual CT parameters remains underexplored. Purpose To evaluate the ability of automated CT-derived markers to predict diabetes and associated cardiometabolic comorbidities. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included Korean adults (age ≥ 25 years) who underwent health screening with fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT between January 2012 and December 2015. Fully automated CT markers included visceral and subcutaneous fat, muscle, bone density, liver fat, all normalized to height (in meters squared), and aortic calcification. Predictive performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Harrell C-index in the cross-sectional and survival analyses, respectively. Results The cross-sectional and cohort analyses included 32166 (mean age, 45 years ± 6 [SD], 28833 men) and 27 298 adults (mean age, 44 years ± 5 [SD], 24 820 men), respectively. Diabetes prevalence and incidence was 6% at baseline and 9% during the 7.3-year median follow-up, respectively. Visceral fat index showed the highest predictive performance for prevalent and incident diabetes, yielding AUC of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.71) for men and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.85) for women and C-index of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.69) for men and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.86) for women, respectively. Combining visceral fat, muscle area, liver fat fraction, and aortic calcification improved predictive performance, yielding C-indexes of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.71) for men and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.87) for women. The AUC for visceral fat index in identifying metabolic syndrome was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.81) for men and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.91) for women.

Purpose To assess the reliability of CT enterography features to describe Crohn disease strictures and their correlation with stricture severity. Materials and Methods A retrospective study was conducted in 43 adult patients with symptomatic terminal ileal Crohn disease strictures who underwent standard-of-care CT enterography at a tertiary care center at the Cleveland Clinic between January 2008 and August 2016. After training on standardized definitions, four abdominal radiologists blinded to all patient information assessed imaging features (seven continuous measurements and nine observations) of the most distal ileal stricture in two separate sessions (separated by ≥2 weeks) in random order. Features with an interrater intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.41 or greater (ie, moderate reliability or better) were considered reliable. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analysis identified reliable features associated with a visual analog scale of overall stricture severity. Significant reliable features were assessed as components of a CT enterography-based model to quantitate stricture severity. Results Examinations in 43 patients (mean age, 52 years ± 16 [SD]; 23 female) were evaluated. Five continuous measurements and six observations demonstrated at least moderate interrater reliability (interrater ICC range, 0.42 [95% CI: 0.25, 0.57] to 0.80 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.88]). Of these, 10 were univariably associated with stricture severity, and three continuous measurements-stricture length (interrater ICC, 0.64 [95% CI: 0.42, 0.81]), maximal associated small bowel dilation (interrater ICC, 0.80 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.88]), and maximal stricture wall thickness (interrater ICC, 0.50 [95% CI: 0.34, 0.62])-were independently associated (P value range, <.001 to .003) with stricture severity in a multivariable model. These three measurements were used to derive a well-calibrated (optimism-adjusted calibration slope = 1.00) quantitative model of stricture severity. Conclusion Standardized CT enterography measurements and observations can reliably describe terminal ileal Crohn disease strictures. Stricture length, maximal associated small bowel dilation, and maximal stricture wall thickness are correlated with stricture severity. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Reliability of MR Enterography Features for Describing Fibrostenosing Crohn Disease.",
    "abstract": "Background Clinical decision making and drug development for fibrostenosing Crohn disease is constrained by a lack of imaging definitions, scoring conventions, and validated end points. Purpose To assess the reliability of MR enterography features to describe Crohn disease strictures and determine correlation with stricture severity. Materials and Methods A retrospective study of patients with symptomatic terminal ileal Crohn disease strictures who underwent MR enterography at tertiary care centers (Cleveland Clinic: September 2013 to November 2020; Mayo Clinic: February 2008 to March 2019) was conducted by using convenience sampling. In the development phase, blinded and trained radiologists independently evaluated 26 MR enterography features from baseline and follow-up examinations performed more than 6 months apart, with no bowel resection performed between examinations. Follow-up examinations closest to 12 months after baseline were selected. Reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). In the validation phase, after five features were redefined, reliability was re-estimated in an independent convenience sample using baseline examinations. Multivariable linear regression analysis identified features with at least moderate interrater reliability (ICC ≥0.41) that were independently associated with stricture severity. Results Ninety-nine (mean age, 40 years ± 14 [SD]; 50 male) patients were included in the development group and 51 (mean age, 45 years ± 16 [SD]; 35 female) patients were included in the validation group. In the development group, nine features had at least moderate interrater reliability. One additional feature demonstrated moderate reliability in the validation group. Stricture length (ICC = 0.85 [95% CI: 0.75, 0.91] and 0.91 [95% CI: 0.75, 0.96] in development and validation phase, respectively) and maximal associated small bowel dilation (ICC = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.63, 0.80] and 0.73 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.87] in development and validation group, respectively) had the highest interrater reliability. Stricture length, maximal stricture wall thickness, and maximal associated small bowel dilation were independently (regression coefficients, 0.09-3.97; P < .001) associated with stricture severity. Conclusion MR enterography definitions and scoring conventions for reliably assessing features of Crohn disease strictures were developed and validated, and feature correlation with stricture severity was determined. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Somatostatin receptors, and specifically somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2), have primarily been associated with neuroendocrine tumors and have revolutionized the imaging and therapy of patients with these tumors. SSTR2 is expressed on other tumors at lower prevalence. Purpose To evaluate the potential of SSTR2-targeted imaging and therapy in patients with breast cancer. Materials and Methods In a preclinical experiment, SSTR2 expression was assessed in tissue microarrays of breast cancer samples using H-score analysis. H-scores higher than 50 (0-300 scale) were considered positive. Then, a prospective phase 2 clinical trial of SSTR2-targeted tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid octreotate (Dotatate) PET/CT was performed in participants with biopsy-proven estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer from January to August 2023. A positive Dotatate PET/CT scan was defined as tumors with a Krenning score of 3 (avidity greater than liver) or 4 (avidity greater than spleen). The proportion of positive scans and the 95% CI were calculated. One participant with metastatic ER-positive breast cancer and a Krenning 4 Dotatate PET/CT result underwent treatment with SSTR2-targeted actinium 225 (225Ac) Dotatate. Results Preclinical microarrays demonstrated that 63 of 123 ER-positive breast cancer tissue samples (51% [95% CI: 42, 60]) but only 22 of 121 ER-negative breast cancer tissue samples (18% [95% CI: 12, 26]) were enriched for SSTR2 (P < .001). Thirty female participants (mean age, 66 years ± 15) with metastatic ER-positive breast cancer were accrued to the phase 2 SSTR2-targeted imaging trial and underwent Dotatate PET/CT. Dotatate PET/CT demonstrated that nine of 30 participants (30% [95% CI: 15, 49]) had tumors with Krenning scores of 3 or 4, indicating strong SSTR2 expression. SSTR2-targeted therapy with alpha-emitting 225Ac-Dotatate resulted in a near complete response in a heavily pretreated participant with metastatic ER-positive breast cancer and a Krenning 4 Dotatate PET result. Conclusion Molecular imaging targeting SSTR2 and radioligand therapy with SSTR2-targeted 225Ac-Dotatate enables a new therapeutic option for patients with metastatic breast cancer.

    "title": "Assessing Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Impact on Early Cancer Detection: Insights from Consecutive Screening.",
    "abstract": "Background Analysis of how digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening affects consecutive screening performance is important to estimate its future value in screening. Purpose To evaluate whether DBT contributes to early detection of breast cancer by assessing cancer detection rates (CDRs), including the fraction of invasive cancers and cancer subtypes in consecutive routine digital mammography (DM). Materials and Methods The paired prospective Malmö Breast Tomosynthesis Screening Trial (MBTST) was performed between January 2010 and February 2015. Participating women underwent one-view DBT and two-view DM at one screening occasion. In this secondary analysis, women were followed up through their first (DM1) and second (DM2) consecutive two-view DM screening rounds after MBTST participation. Cancer diagnoses were identified by referencing records. A logistic regression model, adjusted for age, was used to calculate the odds of luminal A-like cancers with use of the MBTST as reference. Results There were 14 848 final participants in the MBTST (median age, 57 years [IQR, 49-65 years]). Of those, 12 876 women were screened in DM1 (median age, 58 years [IQR, 50-66 years]) and 10 883 were screened in DM2 (median age, 59 years [IQR, 51-67 years]). Compared with CDRs in the trial of 6.5 of 1000 women (95% CI: 5.2, 7.9) for DM and 8.7 of 1000 women (95% CI: 7.3, 10.3) for DBT, the CDR was lower in DM1 (4.6 of 1000 women [95% CI: 3.6, 5.9]) and DM2 (5.3 of 1000 women [95% CI: 4.1, 6.9]). The proportion of invasive cancers was 84.9% (118 of 139 cancers) in the MBTST; the corresponding numbers were 66% (39 of 59 cancers) for DM1 and 83% (50 of 60 cancers) for DM2. The odds of luminal A-like cancers were lower in DM1 at 0.28 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.66 [P = .004]) but not in DM2 at 0.80 (95% CI: 0.40, 1.58 [P = .52]) versus screening in the MBTST. Conclusion CDR and the fraction of invasive cancers were lower in DM1 and then increased in DM2 following the MBTST, indicating earlier cancer detection mainly due to increased detection of luminal A-like cancers in DBT screening.

    "title": "Overestimation of the Ischemic Core Is Associated With Higher Core Lesion Volume and Degree of Reperfusion After Thrombectomy.",
    "abstract": "Background CT perfusion (CTP)-derived baseline ischemic core volume (ICV) can overestimate the true extent of infarction, which may result in exclusion of patients with ischemic stroke from endovascular treatment (EVT). Purpose To determine whether ischemic core overestimation is associated with larger ICV and degree of recanalization. Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter cohort study included patients with acute ischemic stroke triaged at multimodal CT who underwent EVT between January 2015 and January 2022. The primary outcome was ischemic core overestimation, which was assumed when baseline CTP-derived ICV was larger than the final infarct volume at follow-up imaging. The secondary outcome was functional independence defined as modified Rankin Scale scores of 0-2 90 days after EVT. Successful vessel recanalization was defined as extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score of 2b or higher. Categorical variables were compared between patients with ICV of 50 mL or less versus large ICV greater than 50 mL with use of the χ2 test. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to assess the primary and secondary outcomes. Results In total, 721 patients (median age, 76 years [IQR, 64-83 years]; 371 female) were included, of which 162 (22%) demonstrated ischemic core overestimation. Core overestimation occurred more often in patients with ICV greater than 50 mL versus 50 mL or less (48% vs 16%; P < .001) and those with successful versus unsuccessful vessel recanalization (26% vs 13%; P < .001). In an adjusted model, successful recanalization after EVT (odds ratio [OR], 3.14 [95% CI: 1.65, 5.95]; P < .001) and larger ICV (OR, 1.03 [95% CI: 1.02, 1.04]; P < .001) were independently associated with core overestimation, while the time from symptom onset to imaging showed no association (OR, 0.99; P = .96). Core overestimation was independently associated with functional independence (adjusted OR, 2.83 [95% CI: 1.66, 4.81]; P < .001) after successful recanalization. Conclusion Ischemic core overestimation occurred more frequently in patients presenting with large CTP-derived ICV and successful vessel recanalization compared with those with unsuccessful recanalization. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background Contrast-unenhanced abdominal CT is the imaging standard for urinary calculi detection; however, studies comparing photon-counting detector (PCD) CT and energy-integrating detector (EID) CT dose-reduction potentials are lacking. Purpose To compare the radiation dose and image quality of optimized EID CT with those of an experimental PCD CT scan protocol including tin prefiltration in patients suspected of having urinary calculi. Materials and Methods This retrospective single-center study included patients who underwent unenhanced abdominal PCD CT or EID CT for suspected urinary caliculi between February 2022 and March 2023. Signal and noise measurements were performed at three anatomic levels (kidney, psoas, and obturator muscle). Nephrolithiasis and/or urolithiasis presence was independently assessed by three radiologists, and diagnostic confidence was recorded on a five-point scale (1, little to no confidence; 5, complete confidence). Reader agreement was determined by calculating Krippendorff α. Results A total of 507 patients (mean age, 51.7 years ± 17.4 [SD]; 317 male patients) were included (PCD CT group, 229 patients; EID CT group, 278 patients). Readers 1, 2, and 3 detected nephrolithiasis in 129, 127, and 129 patients and 94, 94, and 94 patients, whereas the readers detected urolithiasis in 113, 114, and 114 patients and 152, 153, and 152 patients in the PCD CT and EID CT groups, respectively. Regardless of protocol (PCD CT or EID CT) or calculus localization, near perfect interreader agreement was found (α ≥ 0.99; 95% CI: 0.99, 1). There was no evidence of a difference in reader confidence between PCD CT and EID CT (median confidence, 5; IQR, 5-5; P ≥ .57). The effective doses were 0.79 mSv (IQR, 0.63-0.99 mSv) and 1.39 mSv (IQR, 1.01-1.87 mSv) for PCD CT and EID CT, respectively. Despite the lower radiation exposure, the signal-to-noise ratios at the kidney, psoas, and obturator levels were 30%, 23%, and 17% higher, respectively, in the PCD CT group (P < .001). Conclusion Submillisievert abdominal PCD CT provided high-quality images for the diagnosis of urinary calculi; radiation exposure was reduced by 44% with a higher signal-to-noise ratio than with EID CT and with no evidence of a difference in reader confidence.

The patient denied chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, or recent exposure to sick individuals. He was not on any medications and denied alcohol or illicit drug use. Vital signs were unremarkable. Physical examination was notable for a left-sided pronator drift and bilateral dysmetria that was more pronounced on the left. Results of routine laboratory workup, including complete blood count, metabolic panel, and high-sensitivity troponin level, were normal. An electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, T-wave inversions in the inferior leads, left axis deviation, incomplete right bundle branch block, and frequent premature ventricular contractions. A radiograph of the chest was unremarkable. CT of the head without contrast enhancement demonstrated no acute intracranial abnormities. MRI of the brain without contrast enhancement revealed multiple acute infarcts involving left posterior inferior cerebellar artery distribution, right cerebellar hemisphere, right mesial temporal lobe, and right posterior limb of the internal capsule. CT angiography of the head and neck showed an occlusion of the right posterior cerebral artery near its origin, with a trace of distal flow. Given that these findings were concerning for a cardioembolic etiology of acute ischemic stroke, transesophageal echocardiography was performed. This showed mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 40%, mild global hypokinesis, and an additional finding also seen at subsequent cardiac CT and MRI that will be disclosed in part 2 of the case. The patient was started on systemic anticoagulation and guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. CT of the chest showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy or abnormalities in the lung parenchyma or interstitium. Coronary CT angiography was performed (Fig 1), followed by cardiac MRI (Fig 2).",

    "abstract": "Systemic immunotherapies have led to tremendous progress across the cancer landscape. However, several challenges exist, potentially limiting their efficacy in the treatment of solid tumors. Direct intratumoral injection can increase the therapeutic index of immunotherapies while overcoming many of the barriers associated with systemic administration, including limited bioavailability to tumors and potential systemic safety concerns. However, challenges remain, including the lack of standardized approaches for administration, issues relating to effective drug delivery, logistical hurdles, and safety concerns specific to this mode of administration. This article reviews the biologic rationale for the localized injection of immunotherapeutic agents into tumors. It also addresses the existing limitations and practical considerations for safe and effective implementation and provide recommendations for optimizing logistics and treatment workflows. It also highlights the critical role that radiologists, interventional radiologists, and medical physicists play in intratumoral immunotherapy with respect to target selection, image-guided administration, and response assessment.",

    "abstract": "Background Comparative performance between artificial intelligence (AI) and breast US for women with dense breasts undergoing screening mammography remains unclear. Purpose To compare the performance of mammography alone, mammography with AI, and mammography plus supplemental US for screening women with dense breasts, and to investigate the characteristics of the detected cancers. Materials and Methods A retrospective database search identified consecutive asymptomatic women (≥40 years of age) with dense breasts who underwent mammography plus supplemental whole-breast handheld US from January 2017 to December 2018 at a primary health care center. Sequential reading for mammography alone and mammography with the aid of an AI system was conducted by five breast radiologists, and their recall decisions were recorded. Results of the combined mammography and US examinations were collected from the database. A dedicated breast radiologist reviewed marks for mammography alone or with AI to confirm lesion identification. The reference standard was histologic examination and 1-year follow-up data. The cancer detection rate (CDR) per 1000 screening examinations, sensitivity, specificity, and abnormal interpretation rate (AIR) of mammography alone, mammography with AI, and mammography plus US were compared. Results Among 5707 asymptomatic women (mean age, 52.4 years ± 7.9 [SD]), 33 (0.6%) had cancer (median lesion size, 0.7 cm). Mammography with AI had a higher specificity (95.3% [95% CI: 94.7, 95.8], P = .003) and lower AIR (5.0% [95% CI: 4.5, 5.6], P = .004) than mammography alone (94.3% [95% CI: 93.6, 94.8] and 6.0% [95% CI: 5.4, 6.7], respectively). Mammography plus US had a higher CDR (5.6 vs 3.5 per 1000 examinations, P = .002) and sensitivity (97.0% vs 60.6%, P = .002) but lower specificity (77.6% vs 95.3%, P < .001) and higher AIR (22.9% vs 5.0%, P < .001) than mammography with AI. Supplemental US alone helped detect 12 cancers, mostly stage 0 and I (92%, 11 of 12). Conclusion Although AI improved the specificity of mammography interpretation, mammography plus supplemental US helped detect more node-negative early breast cancers that were undetected using mammography with AI. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Weakly Supervised Deep Learning in Radiology.",
    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) is currently the standard artificial intelligence tool for computer-based image analysis in radiology. Traditionally, DL models have been trained with strongly supervised learning methods. These methods depend on reference standard labels, typically applied manually by experts. In contrast, weakly supervised learning is more scalable. Weak supervision comprises situations in which only a portion of the data are labeled (incomplete supervision), labels refer to a whole region or case as opposed to a precisely delineated image region (inexact supervision), or labels contain errors (inaccurate supervision). In many applications, weak labels are sufficient to train useful models. Thus, weakly supervised learning can unlock a large amount of otherwise unusable data for training DL models. One example of this is using large language models to automatically extract weak labels from free-text radiology reports. Here, we outline the key concepts in weakly supervised learning and provide an overview of applications in radiologic image analysis. With more fundamental and clinical translational work, weakly supervised learning could facilitate the uptake of DL in radiology and research workflows by enabling large-scale image analysis and advancing the development of new DL-based biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "Background Valvular heart disease and intracardiac shunts can disrupt the balance between left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) stroke volumes. However, the prognostic value of such imbalances has not been established among asymptomatic individuals. Purpose To assess the association between differential ventricular stroke volumes quantified using cardiac MRI and clinical outcomes in individuals without cardiovascular disease. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis of a prospective study included participants without cardiovascular disease at enrollment (July 2000 to July 2002) who underwent cardiac MRI. Differences in stroke volume were calculated as LV stroke volume minus RV stroke volume, and participants were categorized as having balanced (greater than or equal to -30 mL to ≤30 mL), negative (less than -30 mL), or positive (>30 mL) differential stroke volumes. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to test the association between differences in stroke volume and adverse outcomes. Results A cohort of 4058 participants (mean age, 61.4 years ± 10 [SD]; 2120 female) were included and followed up for a median of 18.4 years (IQR, 18.3-18.5 years). During follow-up, 1006 participants died, 235 participants developed heart failure, and 764 participants developed atrial fibrillation. Compared with participants who had a balanced differential stroke volume, those with an increased differential stroke volume showed a higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73 [95% CI: 1.12, 2.67]; P = .01), heart failure (HR, 2.40 [95% CI: 1.11, 5.20]; P = .03), and atrial fibrillation (HR, 1.89 [95% CI: 1.16, 3.08]; P = .01) in adjusted models. Participants in the negative group, with a decreased differential stroke volume, showed an increased risk of heart failure compared with those in the balanced group (HR, 2.09 [95% CI: 1.09, 3.99]; P = .03); however, this was no longer observed after adjusting for baseline LV function (P = .34). Conclusion Participants without cardiovascular disease at the time of study enrollment who had an LV stroke volume exceeding the RV stroke volume by greater than 30 mL had an increased risk of mortality, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation compared with those with balanced stroke volumes.

    "abstract": "Background Impaired glucose metabolism is characteristic of several types of dementia, preceding cognitive symptoms and structural brain changes. Reduced glucose uptake in specific brain regions, detected using fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, is a valuable diagnostic marker in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the use of 18F-FDG PET in clinical practice may be limited by equipment availability and high cost. Purpose To test the feasibility of using MRI-based deuterium (2H) metabolic imaging (DMI) at a clinical magnetic field strength (3 T) to detect and localize changes in the concentration of glucose and its metabolites in the brains of patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD. Materials and Methods Participants were recruited for this prospective case-control pilot study between March 2021 and February 2023. DMI was performed at 3 T using a custom birdcage head coil following oral administration of deuterium-labeled glucose (0.75 g/kg). Unlocalized whole-brain MR spectroscopy (MRS) and three-dimensional MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) (voxel size, 3.2 cm cubic) were performed. Ratios of 2H-glucose, 2H-glutamate and 2H-glutamine (2H-Glx), and 2H-lactate spectroscopic peak signals to 2H-water peak signal were calculated for the whole-brain MR spectra and for individual MRSI voxels. Results A total of 19 participants, including 10 participants with AD (mean age, 68 years ± 5 [SD]; eight males) and nine cognitively healthy control participants (mean age, 70 years ± 6; six males) were evaluated. Whole-brain spectra demonstrated a reduced ratio of 2H-Glx to 2H-glucose peak signals in participants with AD compared with control participants (0.41 ± 0.09 vs 0.58 ± 0.20, respectively; P = .04), suggesting an impairment of oxidative glucose metabolism in AD. However, there was no evidence of localization of these changes to the expected regions of metabolic impairment at MRSI, presumably due to insufficient spatial resolution. Conclusion DMI at 3 T demonstrated impairment of oxidative glucose metabolism in the brains of patients with AD but no evidence of regional signal differences. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background Intraductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive cribriform (Cr) subtypes of prostate cancer (PCa) are an indication of aggressiveness, but the evidence regarding whether MRI can be used to detect Cr/IDC-pattern PCa is contradictory. Purpose To compare the detection of Cr/IDC-pattern PCa at multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)-targeted biopsy versus systematic biopsy in biopsy-naive men at risk for PCa. Materials and Methods This study was a secondary analysis of a prospective randomized controlled trial that recruited participants with a clinical suspicion of PCa between April 2017 and November 2019 at five centers. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either the MRI arm or the systematic biopsy arm. Targeted biopsy was performed in participants with a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score of at least 3. MRI features were recorded, and biopsy slides and prostatectomy specimens were reviewed for the presence or absence of Cr/IDC histologic patterns. Comparison of Cr/IDC patterns was performed using generalized linear mixed modeling. Results A total of 453 participants were enrolled, with 226 in the systematic biopsy arm (median age, 65 years [IQR, 59-70 years]; 196 biopsies available for assessment) and 227 in the mpMRI-targeted biopsy arm (median age, 67 years [IQR, 60-72 years]; 132 biopsies available for assessment). Identification of Cr/IDC PCa was lower in the systematic biopsy arm compared with the mpMRI arm (31 of 196 biopsies [16%] vs 33 of 132 biopsies [25%]; P = .01). No evidence of a difference in mean cancer core length (CCL) (11.3 mm ± 4.4 vs 9.7 mm ± 4.5; P = .09), apparent diffusion coefficient (685 µm2/sec ± 178 vs 746 µm2/sec ± 245; P = .52), or dynamic contrast-enhanced positivity (27 [82%] vs 37 [90%]; P = .33) for clinically significant PCa (csPCa) was observed between participants with or without Cr/IDC disease in the MRI arm. Cr/IDC-positive histologic patterns overall had a higher mean CCL compared with Cr/IDC-negative csPCa (11.1 mm ± 4.4 vs 9.2 mm ± 4.1; P = .009).

    "abstract": "Background Preoperative local-regional tumor staging of gastric cancer (GC) is critical for appropriate treatment planning. The comparative accuracy of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) versus dual-energy CT (DECT) for staging of GC is not known. Purpose To compare the diagnostic accuracy of personalized mpMRI with that of DECT for local-regional T and N staging in patients with GC receiving curative surgical intervention. Materials and Methods Patients with GC who underwent gastric mpMRI and DECT before gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy were eligible for this single-center prospective noninferiority study between November 2021 and September 2022. mpMRI comprised T2-weighted imaging, multiorientational zoomed diffusion-weighted imaging, and extradimensional volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. Dual-phase DECT images were reconstructed at 40 keV and standard 120 kVp-like images. Using gastrectomy specimens as the reference standard, the diagnostic accuracy of mpMRI and DECT for T and N staging was compared by six radiologists in a pairwise blinded manner. Interreader agreement was assessed using the weighted κ and Kendall W statistics. The McNemar test was used for head-to-head accuracy comparisons between DECT and mpMRI. Results This study included 202 participants (mean age, 62 years ± 11 [SD]; 145 male). The interreader agreement of the six readers for T and N staging of GC was excellent for both mpMRI (κ = 0.89 and 0.85, respectively) and DECT (κ = 0.86 and 0.84, respectively). Regardless of reader experience, higher accuracy was achieved with mpMRI than with DECT for both T (61%-77% vs 50%-64%; all P < .05) and N (54%-68% vs 51%-58%; P = .497-.005) staging, specifically T1 (83% vs 65%) and T4a (78% vs 68%) tumors and N1 (41% vs 24%) and N3 (64% vs 45%) nodules (all P < .05).

    "abstract": "Background Pre-existing emphysema is recognized as an indicator of future worsening in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when observed through CT imaging. However, it remains uncertain whether additional factors, such as the spatial compactness of CT emphysema, might also serve as predictors of disease progression. Purpose To evaluate the relationship between the compactness of CT emphysema voxels and emphysema progression. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis uses data from the prospective Canadian Cohort Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) study, examining CT images obtained in participants with and without COPD at baseline and a 3-year follow-up time point (November 2009 to November 2018). Measurements of forced expiratory volume in first second of expiration (FEV1) and diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLco) were collected. The normalized join-count (NJC) measurement from baseline CT images and lung density (LD) changes were analyzed. Emphysema progression was defined as an annualized LD change of less than half an SD below the mean of the participants without COPD with no smoking history. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the association between baseline CT NJC measurements and the annualized change in LD, FEV1, DLco, and emphysema progression versus nonprogression. Results A total of 524 participants (mean age, 66 years ± 10 [SD]; 293 male) (FEV1 percent predicted, 88% ± 19; FEV1/FVC, 67% ± 9; DLco percent predicted, 105% ± 25) were analyzed, 187 (36%) of whom had COPD. CT NJC was associated with the annualized change in LD (P < .001), FEV1 (P = .02), and DLco (P = .01). Additionally, CT NJC predicted emphysema progression versus nonprogression (odds ratio, 2.24; 95% CI: 1.37, 3.50; P < .001).

    "abstract": "Background The level of background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) at breast MRI provides predictive and prognostic information and can have diagnostic implications. However, there is a lack of standardization regarding BPE assessment. Purpose To investigate how well results of quantitative BPE assessment methods correlate among themselves and with assessments made by radiologists experienced in breast MRI. Materials and Methods In this pseudoprospective analysis of 5773 breast MRI examinations from 3207 patients (mean age, 60 years ± 10 [SD]), the level of BPE was prospectively categorized according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System by radiologists experienced in breast MRI. For automated extraction of BPE, fibroglandular tissue (FGT) was segmented in an automated pipeline. Four different published methods for automated quantitative BPE extractions were used: two methods (A and B) based on enhancement intensity and two methods (C and D) based on the volume of enhanced FGT. The results from all methods were correlated, and agreement was investigated in comparison with the respective radiologist-based categorization. For surrogate validation of BPE assessment, how accurately the methods distinguished premenopausal women with (n = 50) versus without (n = 896) antihormonal treatment was determined. Results Intensity-based methods (A and B) exhibited a correlation with radiologist-based categorization of 0.56 ± 0.01 and 0.55 ± 0.01, respectively, and volume-based methods (C and D) had a correlation of 0.52 ± 0.01 and 0.50 ± 0.01 (P < .001). There were notable correlation differences (P < .001) between the BPE determined with the four methods. Among the four quantitation methods, method D offered the highest accuracy for distinguishing women with versus without antihormonal therapy (P = .01). Conclusion Results of different methods for quantitative BPE assessment agree only moderately among themselves or with visual categories reported by experienced radiologists; intensity-based methods correlate more closely with radiologists' ratings than volume-based methods. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Current clinical imaging modalities such as CT and MRI provide resolution adequate to diagnose cardiovascular diseases but cannot depict detailed structural features in the heart across length scales. Hierarchical phase-contrast tomography (HiP-CT) uses fourth-generation synchrotron sources with improved x-ray brilliance and high energies to provide micron-resolution imaging of intact adult organs with unprecedented detail. Purpose To evaluate the capability of HiP-CT to depict the macro- to microanatomy of structurally normal and abnormal adult human hearts ex vivo. Materials and Methods Between February 2021 and September 2023, two adult human donor hearts were obtained, fixed in formalin, and prepared using a mixture of crushed agar in a 70% ethanol solution. One heart was from a 63-year-old White male without known cardiac disease, and the other was from an 87-year-old White female with a history of multiple known cardiovascular pathologies including ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Nondestructive ex vivo imaging of these hearts without exogenous contrast agent was performed using HiP-CT at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Results HiP-CT demonstrated the capacity for high-spatial-resolution, multiscale cardiac imaging ex vivo, revealing histologic-level detail of the myocardium, valves, coronary arteries, and cardiac conduction system across length scales. Virtual sectioning of the cardiac conduction system provided information on fatty infiltration, vascular supply, and pathways between the cardiac nodes and adjacent structures. HiP-CT achieved resolutions ranging from gross (isotropic voxels of approximately 20 µm) to microscopic (approximately 6.4-µm voxel size) to cellular (approximately 2.3-µm voxel size) in scale. The potential for quantitative assessment of features in health and disease was demonstrated. Conclusion HiP-CT provided high-spatial-resolution, three-dimensional images of structurally normal and diseased ex vivo adult human hearts. Whole-heart image volumes were obtained with isotropic voxels of approximately 20 µm, and local regions of interest were obtained with resolution down to 2.3-6.4 µm without the need for sectioning, destructive techniques, or exogenous contrast agents.

    "abstract": "Background Due to conflicting findings in the literature, there are concerns about a lack of objectivity in grading knee osteoarthritis (KOA) on radiographs. Purpose To examine how artificial intelligence (AI) assistance affects the performance and interobserver agreement of radiologists and orthopedists of various experience levels when evaluating KOA on radiographs according to the established Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system. Materials and Methods In this retrospective observer performance study, consecutive standing knee radiographs from patients with suspected KOA were collected from three participating European centers between April 2019 and May 2022. Each center recruited four readers across radiology and orthopedic surgery at in-training and board-certified experience levels. KL grading (KL-0 = no KOA, KL-4 = severe KOA) on the frontal view was assessed by readers with and without assistance from a commercial AI tool. The majority vote of three musculoskeletal radiology consultants established the reference standard. The ordinal receiver operating characteristic method was used to estimate grading performance. Light kappa was used to estimate interrater agreement, and bootstrapped t statistics were used to compare groups. Results Seventy-five studies were included from each center, totaling 225 studies (mean patient age, 55 years ± 15 [SD]; 113 female patients). The KL grades were KL-0, 24.0% (n = 54); KL-1, 28.0% (n = 63); KL-2, 21.8% (n = 49); KL-3, 18.7% (n = 42); and KL-4, 7.6% (n = 17). Eleven readers completed their readings. Three of the six junior readers showed higher KL grading performance with versus without AI assistance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.81 ± 0.017 [SEM] vs 0.88 ± 0.011 [P < .001]; 0.76 ± 0.018 vs 0.86 ± 0.013 [P < .001]; and 0.89 ± 0.011 vs 0.91 ± 0.009 [P = .008]). Interobserver agreement for KL grading among all readers was higher with versus without AI assistance (κ = 0.77 ± 0.018 [SEM] vs 0.85 ± 0.013; P < .001). Board-certified radiologists achieved almost perfect agreement for KL grading when assisted by AI (κ = 0.90 ± 0.01), which was higher than that achieved by the reference readers independently (κ = 0.84 ± 0.017; P = .01). Conclusion AI assistance increased junior readers' radiographic KOA grading performance and increased interobserver agreement for osteoarthritis grading across all readers and experience levels.

    "abstract": "Background Discrepancies in the literature regarding optimal optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) cutoffs for intracranial pressure (ICP) necessitate alternative neuroimaging parameters to improve clinical management. Purpose To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the dimensions of the perineural subarachnoid space to the optic nerve sheath ratio, measured using US, in predicting increased ICP. Materials and Methods In a prospective cohort study from April 2022 to December 2023, patients with suspected increased ICP underwent optic nerve US to determine the dimensions of arachnoid bulk (DAB) ratio and ONSD before invasive ICP measurement. Correlation between the parameters and ICP, as well as diagnostic accuracy, was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. Results A total of 30 participants were included (mean age, 39 years ± 14 [SD]; 24 female). The DAB ratio and ONSD were significantly larger in participants with increased ICP (38% [0.16 of 0.42] and 14% [0.82 of 6.04 mm], respectively; P < .001). The DAB ratio showed a stronger correlation with ICP than ONSD (rs = 0.87 [P < .001] vs rs = 0.61 [P < .001]). The DAB ratio and ONSD optimal cutoffs for increased ICP were 0.5 and 6.5 mm, respectively, and the ratio had higher sensitivity (100% vs 92%) and specificity (94% vs 83%) compared with ONSD. Moreover, the DAB ratio better predicted increased ICP than ONSD, with a higher AUC (0.98 [95% CI: 0.95, 1.00] vs 0.86 [95% CI: 0.71, 0.95], P = .047). Conclusion An imaging ratio was proposed to predict ICP based on the relative anatomy of the cerebrospinal fluid space, demonstrating more accurate diagnosis of increased ICP and a strong correlation with ICP values, suggesting its potential utility as a neuroimaging marker in clinical settings. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Comparing Diagnostic Accuracy of Radiologists versus GPT-4V and Gemini Pro Vision Using Image Inputs from Diagnosis Please Cases.",
    "abstract": "Background The diagnostic abilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs) using direct image inputs and the impact of the temperature parameter of LLMs remain unexplored. Purpose To investigate the ability of GPT-4V and Gemini Pro Vision in generating differential diagnoses at different temperatures compared with radiologists using Radiology Diagnosis Please cases. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included Diagnosis Please cases published from January 2008 to October 2023. Input images included original images and captures of the textual patient history and figure legends (without imaging findings) from PDF files of each case. The LLMs were tasked with providing three differential diagnoses, repeated five times at temperatures 0, 0.5, and 1. Eight subspecialty-trained radiologists solved cases. An experienced radiologist compared generated and final diagnoses, considering the result correct if the generated diagnoses included the final diagnosis after five repetitions. Accuracy was assessed across models, temperatures, and radiology subspecialties, with statistical significance set at P < .007 after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons across the LLMs at the three temperatures and with radiologists. Results A total of 190 cases were included in neuroradiology (n = 53), multisystem (n = 27), gastrointestinal (n = 25), genitourinary (n = 23), musculoskeletal (n = 17), chest (n = 16), cardiovascular (n = 12), pediatric (n = 12), and breast (n = 5) subspecialties. Overall accuracy improved with increasing temperature settings (0, 0.5, 1) for both GPT-4V (41% [78 of 190 cases], 45% [86 of 190 cases], 49% [93 of 190 cases], respectively) and Gemini Pro Vision (29% [55 of 190 cases], 36% [69 of 190 cases], 39% [74 of 190 cases], respectively), although there was no evidence of a statistically significant difference after Bonferroni adjustment (GPT-4V, P = .12; Gemini Pro Vision, P = .04). The overall accuracy of radiologists (61% [115 of 190 cases]) was higher than that of Gemini Pro Vision at temperature 1 (T1) (P < .001), while no statistically significant difference was observed between radiologists and GPT-4V at T1 after Bonferroni adjustment (P = .02). Radiologists (range, 45%-88%) outperformed the LLMs at T1 (range, 24%-75%) in most subspecialties. Conclusion Using direct radiologic image inputs, GPT-4V and Gemini Pro Vision showed improved diagnostic accuracy with increasing temperature settings. Although GPT-4V slightly underperformed compared with radiologists, it nonetheless demonstrated promising potential as a supportive tool in diagnostic decision-making. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Nishino and Ballard in this issue.",

An anteroposterior radiograph of the left hip is shown. Physical therapy was initiated, with no improvement after 2 weeks of therapy. The patient was referred to an orthopedist for further evaluation. At physical examination, the patient endorsed marked left hip pain with hip flexion to 90°, limited internal and external rotation (5° and 15°, respectively), and antalgic gait favoring the left leg. Hip MRI and further serologic analysis were requested for further evaluation. Although the serologic testing was performed at an outside laboratory, the physician reported positive immunoglobulin-G Lyme titers, normal C-reactive protein level, and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Pelvic CT was requested. The patient was prescribed a course of doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 28 days), with reported resolution of symptoms 2 weeks after initiation of treatment. Three weeks later, the patient presented to our department with recurrent left hip pain, which was similar in severity compared with the initial presentation. A second MRI examination of the left hip was performed 4 months after the initial presentation.",

    "abstract": "Background Diagnosing osteoporosis is challenging due to its often asymptomatic presentation, which highlights the importance of providing screening for high-risk populations. Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) screening in high-risk patients with osteoporosis identified by an artificial intelligence (AI) model using chest radiographs. Materials and Methods This randomized controlled trial conducted at an academic medical center included participants 40 years of age or older who had undergone chest radiography between January and December 2022 without a history of DXA examination. High-risk participants identified with the AI-enabled chest radiographs were randomly allocated to either a screening group, which was offered fully reimbursed DXA examinations between January and June 2023, or a control group, which received usual care, defined as DXA examination by a physician or patient on their own initiative without AI intervention. A logistic regression was used to test the difference in the primary outcome, new-onset osteoporosis, between the screening and control groups. Results Of the 40 658 enrolled participants, 4912 (12.1%) were identified by the AI model as high risk, with 2456 assigned to the screening group (mean age, 71.8 years ± 11.5 [SD]; 1909 female) and 2456 assigned to the control group (mean age, 72.1 years ± 11.8; 1872 female). A total of 315 of 2456 (12.8%) participants in the screening group underwent fully reimbursed DXA, and 237 of 315 (75.2%) were identified with new-onset osteoporosis. After including DXA results by means of usual care in both screening and control groups, the screening group exhibited higher rates of osteoporosis detection (272 of 2456 [11.1%] vs 27 of 2456 [1.1%]; odds ratio [OR], 11.2 [95% CI: 7.5, 16.7]; P < .001) compared with the control group. The ORs of osteoporosis diagnosis were increased in screening group participants who did not meet formalized criteria for DXA compared with those who did (OR, 23.2 [95% CI: 10.2, 53.1] vs OR, 8.0 [95% CI: 5.0, 12.6]; interactive P = .03). Conclusion Providing DXA screening to a high-risk group identified with AI-enabled chest radiographs can effectively diagnose more patients with osteoporosis. Clinical trial registration no.

    "abstract": "Background Whether connectome mapping of structural and functional connectivity across the brain could be used to predict patterns of atrophy progression in patients with mild Parkinson disease (PD) has not been well studied. Purpose To assess the structural and functional connectivity of brain regions in healthy controls and its relationship with the spread of gray matter (GM) atrophy in patients with mild PD. Materials and Methods This prospective study included participants with mild PD and controls recruited from a single center between January 2012 and December 2023. Participants with PD underwent three-dimensional T1-weighted brain MRI, and the extent of regional GM atrophy was determined at baseline and every year for 3 years. The structural and functional brain connectome was constructed using diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional MRI in healthy controls. Disease exposure (DE) indexes-indexes of the pathology of each brain region-were defined as a function of the structural or functional connectivity of all the connected regions in the healthy connectome and the severity of atrophy of the connected regions in participants with PD. Partial correlations were tested between structural and functional DE indexes of each GM region at 1- or 2-year follow-up and atrophy progression at 2- or 3-year follow-up. Prediction models of atrophy at 2- or 3-year follow-up were constructed using exhaustive feature selection. Results A total of 86 participants with mild PD (mean age at MRI, 60 years ± 8 [SD]; 48 male) and 60 healthy controls (mean age at MRI, 62 years ± 9; 31 female) were included. DE indexes at 1 and 2 years were correlated with atrophy at 2 and 3 years (r range, 0.22-0.33; P value range, .002-.04). Models including DE indexes predicted GM atrophy accumulation over 3 years in the right caudate nucleus and some frontal, parietal, and temporal brain regions (R2 range, 0.40-0.61; all P < .001). Conclusion The structural and functional organization of the brain connectome plays a role in atrophy progression in the early stages of PD. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background CT-derived bronchial parameters have been linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma severity, but little is known about these parameters in healthy individuals. Purpose To investigate the distribution of bronchial parameters at low-dose CT in individuals with healthy lungs from a Dutch general population. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, low-dose chest CT performed between May 2017 and October 2022 were obtained from participants who had completed the second-round assessment of the prospective, longitudinal Imaging in Lifelines study. Participants were aged at least 45 years, and those with abnormal spirometry, self-reported respiratory disease, or signs of lung disease at CT were excluded. Airway lumens and walls were segmented automatically. The square root of the bronchial wall area of a hypothetical airway with an internal perimeter of 10 mm (Pi10), luminal area (LA), wall thickness (WT), and wall area percentage were calculated. Associations between sex, age, height, weight, smoking status, and bronchial parameters were assessed using univariable and multivariable analyses. Results The study sample was composed of 8869 participants with healthy lungs (mean age, 60.9 years ± 10.4 [SD]; 4841 [54.6%] female participants), including 3672 (41.4%) never-smokers and 1197 (13.5%) individuals who currently smoke. Bronchial parameters for male participants were higher than those for female participants (Pi10, slope [β] range = 3.49-3.66 mm; LA, β range = 25.40-29.76 mm2; WT, β range = 0.98-1.03 mm; all P < .001). Increasing age correlated with higher Pi10, LA, and WT (r2 range = 0.06-0.09, 0.02-0.01, and 0.02-0.07, respectively; all P < .001). Never-smoking individuals had the lowest Pi10 followed by formerly smoking and currently smoking individuals (3.62 mm ± 0.13, 3.68 mm ± 0.14, and 3.70 mm ± 0.14, respectively; all P < .001). In multivariable regression models, age, sex, height, weight, and smoking history explained up to 46% of the variation in bronchial parameters. Conclusion In healthy individuals, bronchial parameters differed by sex, height, weight, and smoking history; male sex and increasing age were associated with wider lumens and thicker walls. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Eleven years prior, the patient had undergone left ovarian cystectomy for treatment of endometrioma, as well as excision of deep infiltrative endometriosis. The oocyte retrieval procedure, where more than 30 eggs were retrieved, was complicated by ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and intraperitoneal bleeding, which necessitated admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for 3 days.

    "title": "Ultrahigh-Resolution K-Edge Imaging of Coronary Arteries With Prototype Deep-Silicon Photon-Counting CT: Initial Results in Phantoms.",
    "abstract": "Background Photon-counting CT (PCCT) represents a recent advancement in CT, offering improved spatial resolution and spectral separability. By using multiple adjustable energy bins, PCCT enables K-edge imaging, allowing mixed contrast agent distinction. Deep-silicon is a new type of photon-counting detector with different characteristics compared with cadmium photon-counting detectors. Purpose To evaluate the performance of a prototype deep-Si PCCT scanner and compare it with that of a state-of-the-art dual-energy energy-integrating detector (EID) scanner in imaging coronary artery plaques enhanced with iodine and K-edge contrast agents. Materials and Methods A series of 10 three-dimensional-printed inserts (diameter, 3.5 mm) was prepared, and materials mimicking soft and calcified plaques were added to simulate stenosed coronary arteries. Inserts filled with an iodine- or gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) were scanned. Virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) and iodine maps were generated using two- and eight-energy bin data from EID CT and PCCT, respectively. Gadolinium maps were calculated for PCCT. The CT numbers of VMIs and iodine maps were compared. Spatial resolution and blooming artifacts were compared on the 70-keV VMIs in plaque-free and calcified coronary arteries. Results No evidence of a significant difference in the CT number of 70-keV images was found except in inserts containing GBCAs. In the absence of a GBCA, excellent (r > 0.99) agreement for iodine was found. PCCT could quantify the GBCA within 0.2 mg Gd/mL ± 0.8 accuracy of the ground truth, whereas EID CT failed to detect the GBCA. Lumen measurements were more accurate for PCCT than for EID CT, with mean errors of 167 versus 442 µm (P < .001) compared with the 3.5-mm ground truth. Conclusion Deep-Si PCCT demonstrated good accuracy in iodine quantification and could accurately decompose mixtures of two contrast agents. Its improved spatial resolution resulted in sharper images with blooming artifacts reduced by 50% compared with a state-of-the-art dual-energy EID CT scanner. © RSNA, 2024.",

    "abstract": "Background Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) affibody-based tracers could be an alternative to nonspecific radiotracers for noninvasive detection of HER2 expression in breast cancer lesions at PET/CT. Purpose To compare an affibody-based tracer, Al18F-NOTA-HER2-BCH, and fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for detecting HER2-positive breast cancer lesions on PET/CT images. Materials and Methods In this prospective study conducted from June 2020 to July 2023, participants with HER2-positive breast cancer underwent both Al18F-NOTA-HER2-BCH and 18F-FDG PET/CT. HER2 positivity was confirmed with pathologic assessment (immunohistochemistry test results of 3+, or 2+ followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, indicated HER2 amplification). Two independent readers visually assessed the uptake of tracers on images. Lesion uptake was quantified using the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and target to background ratio (TBR) and compared using a general linear mixed model. Results A total of 42 participants (mean age, 56.3 years ± 10.1 [SD]; 41 female) with HER2-positive breast cancer were included; 42 (100%) had tumors that were detected with Al18F-NOTA-HER2-BCH PET/CT and 40 (95.2%) had tumors detected with 18F-FDG PET/CT. Primary tumors in two of 21 participants, lymph node metastases in four of 21 participants, bone metastases in four of 15 participants, and liver metastases in three of nine participants were visualized only with Al18F-NOTA-HER2-BCH. Lung metastasis in one of nine participants was visualized only with 18F-FDG. Al18F-NOTA-HER2-BCH enabled depiction of more suspected HER2-positive primary tumors (26 vs 21) and lymph node (170 vs 130), bone (92 vs 66), and liver (55 vs 27) metastases than 18F-FDG. The SUVmax and TBR values of primary tumors and lymph node, bone, and liver metastases were all higher on Al18F-NOTA-HER2-BCH images than on 18F-FDG images (median SUVmax range, 10.4-13.5 vs 3.4-6.2; P value range, <.001 to .02; median TBR range, 2.7-17.6 vs 1.2-7.8; P value range, <.001 to .001). No evidence of differences in the SUVmax and TBR for chest wall or lung metastases was observed between Al18F-NOTA-HER2-BCH and 18F-FDG (P value range, .06 to .53). Conclusion PET/CT with the affibody-based tracer Al18F-NOTA-HER2-BCH enabled detection of more primary lesions and lymph node, bone, and liver metastases than PET/CT using 18F-FDG.

    "abstract": "Background The role of perivascular space (PVS) dysfunction in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) requires further study. Purpose To compare MRI indexes of PVS across patients with differing severities of OSA and relate them with disease characteristics and treatment. Materials and Methods This single-center prospective study included healthy controls (HCs) and patients with complaints of snoring who underwent MRI and cognitive evaluation between June 2021 and December 2022. Participants with complaints of snoring were classified into four groups (snoring, mild OSA, moderate OSA, and severe OSA). PVS networks were assessed at MRI using PVS volume fraction, extracellular free water (FW), and diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the PVS (DTI-ALPS). One-way analysis of variance and Pearson correlation were used for analysis. Alterations in PVS indexes and cognitive performance after treatment were assessed in 15 participants with moderate OSA. Results A total of 105 participants (mean age, 33.4 years ± 8.9 [SD]; 80 males) and 50 HCs (mean age, 37.0 years ± 8.6; 33 males) were included. Higher mean PVS volume fraction was observed in participants with severe OSA (n = 23) than in patients with mild OSA (n = 36) (0.11 vs 0.10; P = .03). Participants with severe OSA exhibited higher mean FW index (0.11) than both HCs (0.10; P < .001) and patients with mild OSA (0.10; P = .003). All patient groups had lower DTI-ALPS than HCs (range, 1.5-1.9 vs 2.1; all P < .001). DTI-ALPS correlated with cognitive performance on the Stroop Color and Word Test (r range, -0.23 to -0.24; P value range, .003-.005). After treatment, PVS indexes changed (P value range, <.001 to .01) and cognitive performance improved (P value range, <.001 to .03). Conclusion Differences in PVS indexes were observed among participants with differing severities of OSA and HCs. Indexes correlated with measures of cognitive function, and changes in indexes and improvement in cognitive performance were observed after treatment in participants with moderate OSA. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Women with dense breasts benefit from supplemental cancer screening with US, but US has low specificity. To evaluate the performance of breast US tomography (UST) combined with full-field digital mammography (FFDM) compared with FFDM alone for breast cancer screening in women with dense breasts. This retrospective multireader multicase study included women with dense breasts who underwent FFDM and UST at 10 centers between August 2017 and October 2019 as part of a prospective case collection registry. All patients in the registry with cancer were included; patients with benign biopsy or negative follow-up imaging findings were randomly selected for inclusion. Thirty-two Mammography Quality Standards Act-qualified radiologists independently evaluated FFDM followed immediately by FFDM plus UST for suspicious findings and assigned a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category. The superiority of FFDM plus UST versus FFDM alone for cancer detection (assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]), BI-RADS 4 sensitivity, and BI-RADS 3 sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using the two-sided significance level of α = .05. Noninferiority of BI-RADS 4 specificity was evaluated at the one-sided significance level of α = .025 with a -10% margin. Among 140 women (mean age, 56 years ±10 [SD]; 36 with cancer, 104 without), FFDM plus UST achieved superior performance compared with FFDM alone (AUC, 0.60 [95% CI: 0.51, 0.69] vs 0.54 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.64]; P = .03). For FFDM plus UST versus FFDM alone, BI-RADS 4 mean sensitivity was superior (37% [428 of 1152] vs 30% [343 of 1152]; P = .03) and BI-RADS 4 mean specificity was noninferior (82% [2741 of 3328] vs 88% [2916 of 3328]; P = .004). For FFDM plus UST versus FFDM, no difference in BI-RADS 3 mean sensitivity was observed (40% [461 of 1152] vs 33% [385 of 1152]; P = .08), but BI-RADS 3 mean specificity was superior (75% [2491 of 3328] vs 69% [2299 of 3328]; P = .04). In women with dense breasts, FFDM plus UST improved cancer detection by radiologists versus FFDM alone. Clinical trial registration nos.

    "title": "Large Language Models for Automated Synoptic Reports and Resectability Categorization in Pancreatic Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Background Structured radiology reports for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) improve surgical decision-making over free-text reports, but radiologist adoption is variable. Resectability criteria are applied inconsistently. Purpose To evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in automatically creating PDAC synoptic reports from original reports and to explore performance in categorizing tumor resectability. Materials and Methods In this institutional review board-approved retrospective study, 180 consecutive PDAC staging CT reports on patients referred to the authors' European Society for Medical Oncology-designated cancer center from January to December 2018 were included. Reports were reviewed by two radiologists to establish the reference standard for 14 key findings and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) resectability category. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (accessed September 18-29, 2023) were prompted to create synoptic reports from original reports with the same 14 features, and their performance was evaluated (recall, precision, F1 score). To categorize resectability, three prompting strategies (default knowledge, in-context knowledge, chain-of-thought) were used for both LLMs. Hepatopancreaticobiliary surgeons reviewed original and artificial intelligence (AI)-generated reports to determine resectability, with accuracy and review time compared. The McNemar test, t test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and mixed effects logistic regression models were used where appropriate. Results GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 in the creation of synoptic reports (F1 score: 0.997 vs 0.967, respectively). Compared with GPT-3.5, GPT-4 achieved equal or higher F1 scores for all 14 extracted features. GPT-4 had higher precision than GPT-3.5 for extracting superior mesenteric artery involvement (100% vs 88.8%, respectively). For categorizing resectability, GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 for each prompting strategy. For GPT-4, chain-of-thought prompting was most accurate, outperforming in-context knowledge prompting (92% vs 83%, respectively; P = .002), which outperformed the default knowledge strategy (83% vs 67%, P < .001). Surgeons were more accurate in categorizing resectability using AI-generated reports than original reports (83% vs 76%, respectively; P = .03), while spending less time on each report (58%; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.62). Conclusion GPT-4 created near-perfect PDAC synoptic reports from original reports. GPT-4 with chain-of-thought achieved high accuracy in categorizing resectability. Surgeons were more accurate and efficient using AI-generated reports. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article. See also the editorial by Chang in this issue.",

Accommodating custom integrations creates a substantial operational and maintenance burden. These custom integrations also increase the likelihood of unanticipated problems. Standards-based interoperability facilitates AI integration with systems from different vendors into a single environment by enabling seamless exchange between information systems in the radiology workflow. Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) is an initiative to improve how computer systems share information across health care domains, including radiology. IHE integrates existing standards-such as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine, Health Level Seven, and health care lexicons and ontologies (ie, LOINC, RadLex, SNOMED Clinical Terms)-by mapping data elements from one standard to another. IHE Radiology manages profiles (standards-based implementation guides) for departmental workflow and information sharing across care sites, including profiles for scaling AI processing traffic and integrating AI results. This review focuses on the need for standards-based interoperability to scale AI integration in radiology, including a brief review of recent IHE profiles that provide a framework for AI integration. This review also discusses challenges and additional considerations for AI integration, including technical, clinical, and policy perspectives.",

Studies investigating the positive predictive value (PPV) of bpMRI-directed compared with mpMRI-directed targeted biopsy are lacking in the literature. Purpose To compare the PPVs of bpMRI-directed and mpMRI-directed targeted prostate biopsies. Materials and Methods This retrospective cross-sectional study evaluated men who underwent bpMRI-directed or mpMRI-directed transrectal US (TRUS)-guided targeted prostate biopsy at a single institution from January 2015 to December 2022. The PPVs for any prostate cancer (PCa) and clinically significant PCa (International Society of Urological Pathology grade ≥2) were calculated for bpMRI and mpMRI using mixed-effects logistic regression modeling. Results A total of 1538 patients (mean age, 67 years ± 8 [SD]) with 1860 lesions underwent bpMRI-directed (55%, 849 of 1538) or mpMRI-directed (45%, 689 of 1538) prostate biopsy. When adjusted for the number of lesions and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score, there was no difference in PPVs for any PCa or clinically significant PCa (P = .61 and .97, respectively) with bpMRI-directed (55% [95% CI: 51, 59] and 34% [95% CI: 30, 38], respectively) or mpMRI-directed (56% [95% CI: 52, 61] and 34% [95% CI: 30, 39], respectively) TRUS-guided targeted biopsy. PPVs for any PCa and clinically significant PCa stratified according to clinical indication were as follows: biopsy-naive men, 64% (95% CI: 59, 69) and 43% (95% CI: 39, 48) for bpMRI, 67% (95% CI: 59, 75) and 51% (95% CI: 43, 59) for mpMRI (P = .65 and .26, respectively); and active surveillance, 59% (95% CI: 49, 69) and 30% (95% CI: 22, 39) for bpMRI, 73% (95% CI: 65, 89) and 38% (95% CI: 31, 47) for mpMRI (P = .04 and .23, respectively).

    "abstract": "Background Visual assessment of amyloid PET scans relies on the availability of radiologist expertise, whereas quantification of amyloid burden typically involves MRI for processing and analysis, which can be computationally expensive. Purpose To develop a deep learning model to classify minimally processed brain PET scans as amyloid positive or negative, evaluate its performance on independent data sets and different tracers, and compare it with human visual reads. Materials and Methods This retrospective study used 8476 PET scans (6722 patients) obtained from late 2004 to early 2023 that were analyzed across five different data sets. A deep learning model, AmyloidPETNet, was trained on 1538 scans from 766 patients, validated on 205 scans from 95 patients, and internally tested on 184 scans from 95 patients in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) fluorine 18 (18F) florbetapir (FBP) data set. It was tested on ADNI scans using different tracers and scans from independent data sets. Scan amyloid positivity was based on mean cortical standardized uptake value ratio cutoffs. To compare with model performance, each scan from both the Centiloid Project and a subset of the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (A4) study were visually interpreted with a confidence level (low, intermediate, high) of amyloid positivity/negativity. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and other performance metrics were calculated, and Cohen κ was used to measure physician-model agreement. Results The model achieved an AUC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95, 0.99) on test ADNI 18F-FBP scans, which generalized well to 18F-FBP scans from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (AUC, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.97) and the A4 study (AUC, 0.98; 95% CI: 0.98, 0.98). Model performance was high when applied to data sets with different tracers (AUC ≥ 0.97). Other performance metrics provided converging evidence. Physician-model agreement ranged from fair (Cohen κ = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.60) on a sample of mostly equivocal cases from the A4 study to almost perfect (Cohen κ = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.86, 1.0) on the Centiloid Project. Conclusion The developed model was capable of automatically and accurately classifying brain PET scans as amyloid positive or negative without relying on experienced readers or requiring structural MRI.

Purpose To evaluate the safety of the GBCA gadoxetate disodium (a linear ionic hepatobiliary contrast agent [HBA]) in children and adolescents, compared with extracellular contrast agents (ECA). Materials and Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted in children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger who underwent HBA-enhanced MRI at one of three tertiary hospitals from January 2010 to December 2022. The incidence of GBCA-associated acute adverse events was compared between MRI examinations with a HBA and those with ECA. Severity was categorized according to American College of Radiology guidelines (mild, moderate, or severe). (a) Propensity score matching using multivariable logistic regression models and (b) inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis based on nine covariates (age, sex, asthma, allergic rhinitis, chronic urticaria or atopy, food allergy, drug allergy, premedication, and history of GBCA-associated adverse events) were used for confounder adjustment. Results A total of 1629 MRI examinations (ECA, n = 1256; HBA, n = 373) in 1079 patients were included (mean age, 8.6 years ± 6.5; 566 girls). The per-examination incidence of GBCA-associated acute adverse events showed no evidence of a difference, with rates of 0.9% (11 of 1256 examinations) for ECA and 1.3% (five of 373 examinations) for HBA (odds ratio [OR], 1.55 [95% CI: 0.54, 4.46]; P = .42). Acute adverse events were all mild with ECA, whereas with HBA, they were mild for four patients and moderate for one patient. There was no evidence of a difference in the incidence of acute adverse events, even in propensity score matching (OR, 1.33 [95% CI: 0.30, 5.96]; P = .71) and inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis (OR, 0.84 [95% CI: 0.25, 2.86]; P = .78). Conclusion Gadoxetate disodium showed no difference in acute adverse events compared with ECA in children and adolescents, with further large-scale pediatric studies required to confirm its safety. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Acute arterial mesenteric ischemia requires emergency treatment and is associated with high mortality rate and poor quality of life. Identifying factors associated with survival without intestinal resection (hereafter, intestinal resection-free [IRF] survival) could help in treatment decision-making after first-line endovascular revascularization. Purpose To identify factors associated with 30-day IRF survival in patients with acute arterial mesenteric ischemia whose first-line treatment was endovascular revascularization. Materials and Methods Patients with acute arterial mesenteric ischemia whose first-line treatment was endovascular revascularization because of a low probability of bowel necrosis were included in this single-center retrospective cohort (May 2014 to August 2022). Patient demographics, laboratory values, clinical characteristics at admission, CT scans, angiograms, and endovascular revascularization-related variables were included. The primary end point was 30-day IRF survival, and secondary end points were 3-month, 1-year, and 3-year overall survival. Factors independently associated with 30-day IRF survival were identified with binary logistic regression. Results A total of 117 patients (median age, 70 years [IQR, 60-77]; 53 female, 64 male) were included. Within 30 days after revascularization, 73 of 117 patients (62%) survived without resection, 28 of 117 (24%) survived after resection, 14 of 117 (12%) died without resection, and two of 117 (2%) underwent resection but died. The 30-day IRF survival was 63% (74 of 117). The 3-month, 1-year, and 3-year mortality rate was 18% (21 of 117), 21% (25 of 117), and 27% (32 of 117), respectively. Independent predictors of 30-day IRF survival were persistent bowel enhancement at initial CT (odds ratio [OR], 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.8; P = .013) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level less than 100 mg/L (OR, 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.8; P = .002). The 30-day IRF survival was 86%, 61%, 47%, and 23% in patients with both favorable features, persistent bowel enhancement but CRP level greater than 100 mg/L, no bowel enhancement but CRP level less than 100 mg/L, and both unfavorable features, respectively. Conclusion Independent predictors associated with 30-day IRF survival in patients with acute arterial mesenteric ischemia whose first-line treatment was endovascular revascularization were persistent bowel wall enhancement at initial CT and CRP level less than 100 mg/L. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Whereas previous projects attempted to standardize imaging in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), few studies have been published about the need for specific details regarding the image acquisition and lesions that may be less familiar to general radiologists. This work reports consensus recommendations developed by the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) that aim to standardize the imaging reports in patients suspected of having or with known axSpA. A task force consisting of radiologists and rheumatologists from ASAS and one patient representative formulated two surveys that were completed by ASAS members. The results of these surveys led to the development of 10 recommendations that were endorsed by 73% (43 of 59) of ASAS members. The recommendations are targeted to the radiologist and include best practices for the inclusion of clinical information, technical details, image quality, and imaging findings in radiology reports. These recommendations also emphasize that imaging findings that indicate differential diagnoses and referral suggestions should be included in the concluding section of the radiology report. With these recommendations, ASAS aims to improve the diagnostic process and care for patients suspected of having or with known axSpA.",

    "title": "Tumor Stiffness Measurement at Multifrequency MR Elastography to Predict Lymphovascular Space Invasion in Endometrial Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Background Pathologic lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) is associated with poor outcome in endometrial cancer. Its relationship with tumor stiffness, which can be measured with use of MR elastography, has not been extensively explored. Purpose To assess whether MR elastography-based mechanical characteristics can aid in the noninvasive prediction of LVSI in patients with endometrial cancer. Materials and Methods This prospective study included consecutive adult patients with a suspected uterine tumor who underwent MRI and MR elastography between October 2022 and July 2023. A region of interest delineated on T2-weighted magnitude images was duplicated on MR elastography images and used to calculate c (stiffness in meters per second) and φ (viscosity in radians) values. Pathologic assessment of hysterectomy specimens for LVSI served as the reference standard. Data were compared between LVSI-positive and -negative groups with use of the Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine variables associated with LVSI positivity and develop diagnostic models for predicting LVSI. Model performance was assessed with use of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared using the DeLong test. Results A total of 101 participants were included, 72 who were LVSI-negative (median age, 53 years [IQR, 48-62 years]) and 29 who were LVSI-positive (median age, 54 years [IQR, 49-60 years]). The tumor stiffness in the LVSI-positive group was higher than in the LVSI-negative group (median, 4.1 m/sec [IQR, 3.2-4.6 m/sec] vs 2.2 m/sec [IQR, 2.0-2.8 m/sec]; P < .001). Tumor volume, cancer antigen 125 level, and tumor stiffness were associated with LVSI positivity (adjusted odds ratio range, 1.01-9.06; P range, <.001-.04). The combined model (AUC, 0.93) showed better performance for predicting LVSI compared with clinical-radiologic model (AUC, 0.77; P = .003) and similar performance to the MR elastography-based model (AUC, 0.89; P = .06). Conclusion The addition of tumor stiffness as measured at MR elastography into a clinical-radiologic model improved prediction of LVSI in patients with endometrial cancer. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Early Indicators of the Impact of Using AI in Mammography Screening for Breast Cancer.",
    "abstract": "Background Retrospective studies have suggested that using artificial intelligence (AI) may decrease the workload of radiologists while preserving mammography screening performance. Purpose To compare workload and screening performance for two cohorts of women who underwent screening before and after AI system implementation. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 50-69-year-old women who underwent biennial mammography screening in the Capital Region of Denmark. Before AI system implementation (October 1, 2020, to November 17, 2021), all screenings involved double reading. For screenings conducted after AI system implementation (November 18, 2021, to October 17, 2022), likely normal screenings (AI examination score ≤5 before May 3, 2022, or ≤7 on or after May 3, 2022) were single read by one of 19 senior full-time breast radiologists. The remaining screenings were read by two radiologists with AI-assisted decision support. Biopsy and surgical outcomes were retrieved between October 1, 2020, and April 15, 2023, ensuring at least 180 days of follow-up. Screening metrics were compared using the χ2 test. Reading workload reduction was measured as saved screening reads. Results In total, 60 751 and 58 246 women were screened before and after AI system implementation, respectively (median age, 58 years [IQR, 54-64 years] for both cohorts), with a median screening interval before AI of 845 days (IQR, 820-878 days) and with AI of 993 days (IQR, 968-1013 days; P < .001). After AI system implementation, the recall rate decreased by 20.5% (3.09% before AI [1875 of 60 751] vs 2.46% with AI [1430 of 58 246]; P < .001), the cancer detection rate increased (0.70% [423 of 60 751] vs 0.82% [480 of 58 246]; P = .01), the false-positive rate decreased (2.39% [1452 of 60 751] vs 1.63% [950 of 58 246]; P < .001), the positive predictive value increased (22.6% [423 of 1875] vs 33.6% [480 of 1430]; P < .001), the rate of small cancers (≤1 cm) increased (36.6% [127 of 347] vs 44.9% [164 of 365]; P = .02), the rate of node-negative cancers was unchanged (76.7% [253 of 330] vs 77.8% [273 of 351]; P = .73), and the rate of invasive cancers decreased (84.9% [359 of 423] vs 79.6% [382 of 480]; P = .04). The reading workload was reduced by 33.5% (38 977 of 116 492 reads). Conclusion In a population-based mammography screening program, using AI reduced the overall workload of breast radiologists while improving screening performance.

    "title": "Effects of Low-Level Light Therapy on Resting-State Connectivity Following Moderate Traumatic Brain Injury: Secondary Analyses of a Double-blinded Placebo-controlled Study.",
    "abstract": "Background Low-level light therapy (LLLT) has been shown to modulate recovery in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the impact of LLLT on the functional connectivity of the brain when at rest has not been well studied. Purpose To use functional MRI to assess the effect of LLLT on whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) in patients with moderate TBI at acute (within 1 week), subacute (2-3 weeks), and late-subacute (3 months) recovery phases. Materials and Methods This is a secondary analysis of a prospective single-site double-blinded sham-controlled study conducted in patients presenting to the emergency department with moderate TBI from November 2015 to July 2019. Participants were randomized for LLLT and sham treatment. The primary outcome of the study was to assess structural connectivity, and RSFC was collected as the secondary outcome. MRI was used to measure RSFC in 82 brain regions in participants during the three recovery phases. Healthy individuals who did not receive treatment were imaged at a single time point to provide control values. The Pearson correlation coefficient was estimated to assess the connectivity strength for each brain region pair, and estimates of the differences in Fisher z-transformed correlation coefficients (hereafter, z differences) were compared between recovery phases and treatment groups using a linear mixed-effects regression model. These analyses were repeated for all brain region pairs. False discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P values were computed to account for multiple comparisons. Quantile mixed-effects models were constructed to quantify the association between the Rivermead Postconcussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) score, recovery phase, and treatment group. Results RSFC was evaluated in 17 LLLT-treated participants (median age, 50 years [IQR, 25-67 years]; nine female), 21 sham-treated participants (median age, 50 years [IQR, 43-59 years]; 11 female), and 23 healthy control participants (median age, 42 years [IQR, 32-54 years]; 13 male). Seven brain region pairs exhibited a greater change in connectivity in LLLT-treated participants than in sham-treated participants between the acute and subacute phases (range of z differences, 0.37 [95% CI: 0.20, 0.53] to 0.45 [95% CI: 0.24, 0.67]; FDR-adjusted P value range, .010-.047). Thirteen different brain region pairs showed an increase in connectivity in sham-treated participants between the subacute and late-subacute phases (range of z differences, 0.17 [95% CI: 0.09, 0.25] to 0.26 [95% CI: 0.14, 0.39]; FDR-adjusted P value range, .020-.047). There was no evidence of a difference in clinical outcomes between LLLT-treated and sham-treated participants (range of differences in medians, -3.54 [95% CI: -12.65, 5.57] to -0.59 [95% CI: -7.31, 8.49]; P value range, .44-.99), as measured according to RPQ scores. Conclusion Despite the small sample size, the change in RSFC from the acute to subacute phases of recovery was greater in LLLT-treated than sham-treated participants, suggesting that acute-phase LLLT may have an impact on resting-state neuronal circuits in the early recovery phase of moderate TBI.

    "title": "Feasibility of Dark-Field Radiography to Enhance Detection of Nondisplaced Fractures.",
    "abstract": "Background Many clinically relevant fractures are occult on conventional radiographs and therefore challenging to diagnose reliably. X-ray dark-field radiography is a developing method that uses x-ray scattering as an additional signal source. Purpose To investigate whether x-ray dark-field radiography enhances the depiction of radiographically occult fractures in an experimental model compared with attenuation-based radiography alone and whether the directional dependence of dark-field signal impacts observer ratings. Materials and Methods Four porcine loin ribs had nondisplaced fractures experimentally introduced. Microstructural changes were visually verified using high-spatial-resolution three-dimensional micro-CT. X-ray dark-field radiographs were obtained before and after fracture, with the before-fracture scans serving as control images. The presence of a fracture was scored by three observers using a six-point scale (6, surely; 5, very likely; 4, likely; 3, unlikely; 2, very unlikely; and 1, certainly not). Differences between scores based on attenuation radiographs alone (n = 96) and based on combined attenuation and dark-field radiographs (n = 96) were evaluated by using the DeLong method to compare areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The impact of the dark-field signal directional sensitivity on observer ratings was evaluated using the Wilcoxon test. The dark-field data were split into four groups (24 images per group) according to their sensitivity orientation and tested against each other. Musculoskeletal dark-field radiography was further demonstrated on human finger and foot specimens. Results The addition of dark-field radiographs was found to increase the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to 1 compared with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.94) using attenuation-based radiographs alone (P < .001). There were similar observer ratings for the four different dark-field sensitivity orientations (P = .16-.65 between the groups). Conclusion These results suggested that the inclusion of dark-field radiography has the potential to help enhance the detection of nondisplaced fractures compared with attenuation-based radiography alone. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Rubin in this issue.",

The patient was taking prednisone and leflunomide to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The headache was primarily left sided and occasionally radiated to the occipital region. The patient had a high-grade fever spike, with a temperature of 104 °F (40 °C). Results of a prior lumbar puncture and temporal artery biopsy from an outside hospital were negative. Findings of a neurologic examination were unremarkable. Oropharyngeal examination for dysphagia revealed minimal pharyngeal motility, with pooling of food in the pharynx, which was thought to be due to cranial nerve dysfunction. Laboratory analysis revealed that, except for anemia, complete blood count parameters were within normal limits. C-reactive protein level (49.7 mg/L; reference range, 0.0-8.0 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (>140 mm/h with Westergren method; reference range, 0-27 mm/h), and brain-type natriuretic peptide level (145 pg/mL; reference range, 0-100 pg/mL) were elevated. Blood and urine cultures were negative. A lumbar puncture was performed, which revealed cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with an elevated CSF protein level (78 mg/dL; reference range, 7.0-35.0 mg/dL) and a low CSF glucose level (37 mg/dL [2.05 mmol/L]; reference range, 45-70 mg/dL [2.50-3.89 mmol/L]); otherwise, CSF encephalopathy, an autoimmune panel, and cultures were negative. CT and MRI of the brain with paranasal sinus were performed. Nasal endoscopy-guided drainage of the preclival fluid collection was performed, and biopsy of nasopharyngeal tissue was performed.

    "abstract": "The American College of Radiology Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) standardizes the imaging technique, reporting lexicon, disease categorization, and management for patients with or at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LI-RADS encompasses HCC surveillance with US; HCC diagnosis with CT, MRI, or contrast-enhanced US (CEUS); and treatment response assessment (TRA) with CT or MRI. LI-RADS was recently expanded to include CEUS TRA after nonradiation locoregional therapy or surgical resection. This report provides an overview of LI-RADS CEUS Nonradiation TRA v2024, including a lexicon of imaging findings, techniques, and imaging criteria for posttreatment tumor viability assessment. LI-RADS CEUS Nonradiation TRA v2024 takes into consideration differences in the CEUS appearance of viable tumor and posttreatment changes within and in close proximity to a treated lesion. Due to the high sensitivity of CEUS to vascular flow, posttreatment reactive changes commonly manifest as areas of abnormal perilesional enhancement without washout, especially in the first 3 months after treatment. To improve the accuracy of CEUS for nonradiation TRA, different diagnostic criteria are used to evaluate tumor viability within and outside of the treated lesion margin. Broader criteria for intralesional enhancement increase sensitivity for tumor viability detection. Stricter criteria for perilesional enhancement limit miscategorization of posttreatment reactive changes as viable tumor. Finally, the TRA algorithm reconciles intralesional and perilesional tumor viability assessment and assigns a single LI-RADS treatment response (LR-TR) category: LR-TR nonviable, LR-TR equivocal, or LR-TR viable.",

Purpose To investigate whether fluorine 18 (18F) prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) 1007 PET/CT after mpMRI can help detect localized clinically significant PCa (csPCa), particularly for equivocal PI-RADS 3 lesions. Materials and Methods This prospective study included participants with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels referred for prostate mpMRI between September 2020 and February 2022. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT was performed within 30 days of mpMRI and before biopsy. PI-RADS category and level of suspicion (LOS) were assessed. PI-RADS 3 or higher lesions at mpMRI and/or LOS 3 or higher lesions at 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT underwent targeted biopsies. PI-RADS 2 or lower and LOS 2 or lower lesions were considered nonsuspicious and were monitored during a 1-year follow-up by means of PSA testing. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed, with histologic examination serving as the reference standard. International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade 2 or higher was considered csPCa. Results Seventy-five participants (median age, 67 years [range, 52-77 years]) were assessed, with PI-RADS 1 or 2, PI-RADS 3, and PI-RADS 4 or 5 groups each including 25 participants. A total of 102 lesions were identified, of which 80 were PI-RADS 3 or higher and/or LOS 3 or higher and therefore underwent targeted biopsy. The per-participant sensitivity for the detection of csPCa was 95% and 91% for mpMRI and 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT, respectively, with respective specificities of 45% and 62%. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT was used to correctly differentiate 17 of 26 PI-RADS 3 lesions (65%), with a negative and positive predictive value of 93% and 27%, respectively, for ruling out or detecting csPCa. One additional significant and one insignificant PCa lesion (PI-RADS 1 or 2) were found at 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT that otherwise would have remained undetected. Two participants had ISUP 2 tumors without PSMA uptake that were missed at PET/CT. Conclusion 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT showed good sensitivity and moderate specificity for the detection of csPCa and ruled this out in 93% of participants with PI-RADS 3 lesions.

    "title": "Evaluation of Reliability, Repeatability, Robustness, and Confidence of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on a Radiology Board-style Examination.",
    "abstract": "Background ChatGPT (OpenAI) can pass a text-based radiology board-style examination, but its stochasticity and confident language when it is incorrect may limit utility. Purpose To assess the reliability, repeatability, robustness, and confidence of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (ChatGPT; OpenAI) through repeated prompting with a radiology board-style examination. Materials and Methods In this exploratory prospective study, 150 radiology board-style multiple-choice text-based questions, previously used to benchmark ChatGPT, were administered to default versions of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on three separate attempts (separated by ≥1 month and then 1 week). Accuracy and answer choices between attempts were compared to assess reliability (accuracy over time) and repeatability (agreement over time). On the third attempt, regardless of answer choice, ChatGPT was challenged three times with the adversarial prompt, \"Your answer choice is incorrect. Please choose a different option,\" to assess robustness (ability to withstand adversarial prompting). ChatGPT was prompted to rate its confidence from 1-10 (with 10 being the highest level of confidence and 1 being the lowest) on the third attempt and after each challenge prompt. Results Neither version showed a difference in accuracy over three attempts: for the first, second, and third attempt, accuracy of GPT-3.5 was 69.3% (104 of 150), 63.3% (95 of 150), and 60.7% (91 of 150), respectively (P = .06); and accuracy of GPT-4 was 80.6% (121 of 150), 78.0% (117 of 150), and 76.7% (115 of 150), respectively (P = .42). Though both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 had only moderate intrarater agreement (κ = 0.78 and 0.64, respectively), the answer choices of GPT-4 were more consistent across three attempts than those of GPT-3.5 (agreement, 76.7% [115 of 150] vs 61.3% [92 of 150], respectively; P = .006). After challenge prompt, both changed responses for most questions, though GPT-4 did so more frequently than GPT-3.5 (97.3% [146 of 150] vs 71.3% [107 of 150], respectively; P < .001). Both rated \"high confidence\" (≥8 on the 1-10 scale) for most initial responses (GPT-3.5, 100% [150 of 150]; and GPT-4, 94.0% [141 of 150]) as well as for incorrect responses (ie, overconfidence; GPT-3.5, 100% [59 of 59]; and GPT-4, 77% [27 of 35], respectively; P = .89). Conclusion Default GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were reliably accurate across three attempts, but both had poor repeatability and robustness and were frequently overconfident. GPT-4 was more consistent across attempts than GPT-3.5 but more influenced by an adversarial prompt. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is increasingly recognized as a powerful diagnostic tool and tested alternative to contrast-enhanced (CE) breast MRI. Purpose To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis that assesses the diagnostic performance of DWI-based noncontrast MRI protocols (ncDWI) for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Materials and Methods A systematic literature search in PubMed for articles published from January 1985 to September 2023 was performed. Studies were excluded if they investigated malignant lesions or selected patients and/or lesions only, used DWI as an adjunct technique to CE MRI, or were technical studies. Statistical analysis included pooling of diagnostic accuracy and investigating between-study heterogeneity. Additional subgroup comparisons of ncDWI to CE MRI and standard mammography were performed. Results A total of 28 studies were included, with 4406 lesions (1676 malignant, 2730 benign) in 3787 patients. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of ncDWI were 86.5% (95% CI: 81.4, 90.4) and 83.5% (95% CI: 76.9, 88.6), and both measures presented with high between-study heterogeneity (I 2 = 81.6% and 91.6%, respectively; P < .001). CE MRI (18 studies) had higher sensitivity than ncDWI (95.1% [95% CI: 92.9, 96.7] vs 88.9% [95% CI: 82.4, 93.1], P = .004) at similar specificity (82.2% [95% CI: 75.0, 87.7] vs 82.0% [95% CI: 74.8, 87.5], P = .97). Compared with ncDWI, mammography (five studies) showed no evidence of a statistical difference for sensitivity (80.3% [95% CI: 56.3, 93.3] vs 56.7%; [95% CI: 41.9, 70.4], respectively; P = .09) or specificity (89.9% [95% CI: 85.5, 93.1] vs 90% [95% CI: 61.3, 98.1], respectively; P = .62), but ncDWI had a higher area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (0.93 [95% CI: 0.91, 0.95] vs 0.78 [95% CI: 0.74, 0.81], P < .001). Conclusion A direct comparison with CE MRI showed a modestly lower sensitivity at similar specificity for ncDWI, and higher diagnostic performance indexes for ncDWI than standard mammography. Heterogeneity was high, thus these results must be interpreted with caution. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to manage radiologists' workloads. The impact of patient characteristics on AI performance has not been well studied. Purpose To understand the impact of patient characteristics (race and ethnicity, age, and breast density) on the performance of an AI algorithm interpreting negative screening digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) examinations. Materials and Methods This retrospective cohort study identified negative screening DBT examinations from an academic institution from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019. All examinations had 2 years of follow-up without a diagnosis of atypia or breast malignancy and were therefore considered true negatives. A subset of unique patients was randomly selected to provide a broad distribution of race and ethnicity. DBT studies in this final cohort were interpreted by a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved AI algorithm, which generated case scores (malignancy certainty) and risk scores (1-year subsequent malignancy risk) for each mammogram. Positive examinations were classified based on vendor-provided thresholds for both scores. Multivariable logistic regression was used to understand relationships between the scores and patient characteristics. Results A total of 4855 patients (median age, 54 years [IQR, 46-63 years]) were included: 27% (1316 of 4855) White, 26% (1261 of 4855) Black, 28% (1351 of 4855) Asian, and 19% (927 of 4855) Hispanic patients. False-positive case scores were significantly more likely in Black patients (odds ratio [OR] = 1.5 [95% CI: 1.2, 1.8]) and less likely in Asian patients (OR = 0.7 [95% CI: 0.5, 0.9]) compared with White patients, and more likely in older patients (71-80 years; OR = 1.9 [95% CI: 1.5, 2.5]) and less likely in younger patients (41-50 years; OR = 0.6 [95% CI: 0.5, 0.7]) compared with patients aged 51-60 years. False-positive risk scores were more likely in Black patients (OR = 1.5 [95% CI: 1.0, 2.0]), patients aged 61-70 years (OR = 3.5 [95% CI: 2.4, 5.1]), and patients with extremely dense breasts (OR = 2.8 [95% CI: 1.3, 5.8]) compared with White patients, patients aged 51-60 years, and patients with fatty density breasts, respectively.

    "title": "Positive Leadership within Breast Imaging: Impact on Burnout, Intent to Leave, and Engagement.",
    "abstract": "Background High rates of provider burnout and turnover, as well as staffing shortages, are creating crises within radiology departments. Identifying ways to support health care workers, such as the Positively Energizing Leadership program, is important during these ongoing crises. Purpose To identify the relationship between leadership behaviors and workplace climate and health care worker outcomes (ie, burnout, intent to leave, and engagement) and to determine whether the positive leadership program could improve workplace climate and health care worker outcomes. Materials and Methods This prospective study involved two parts. First, a web-based survey was administered to faculty and staff in a breast imaging unit of a large academic medical center in February 2021 to identify relationships between leadership behaviors and workplace climate and health care worker outcomes. Second, a web-based survey was administered in February 2023, following the implementation of a positive leadership program, to determine improvement in engagement and reduction of burnout and intent to leave since 2021. Multiple regression, the Sobel test, Pearson correlation, and the t test were used, with a conservative significance level of P < .001. Results The sample consisted of 88 respondents (response rate, 95%) in 2021 and 85 respondents (response rate, 92%) in 2023. Leadership communication was associated with a positive workplace climate (β = 0.76, P < .001) and a positive workplace climate was associated with improved engagement (β = 0.53, P < .001), reduction in burnout (β = -0.42, P < .001), and reduction in intent to leave (β = -0.49, P < .001). Following a 2-year positive leadership program, improved perceptions were observed for leadership communication (pretest mean, 4.59 ± 1.51 [SD]; posttest mean, 5.80 ± 1.01; t = 5.97, P < .001), workplace climate (pretest mean, 5.09 ± 1.43; posttest mean, 5.77 ± 1.11; t = 3.35, P < .001), and engagement (pretest mean, 5.27 ± 1.20, posttest mean, 5.68 ± 0.96; t = 2.50, P < .01), with a reduction in burnout (pretest mean, 2.69 ± 0.94; posttest mean, 2.18 ± 0.74; t = 3.50, P < .001) and intent to leave (pretest mean, 3.12 ± 2.23; posttest mean, 2.56 ± 1.84; t = 1.78, P < .05). Conclusion After implementation of a positive leadership program in a radiology department breast imaging unit, burnout and intention to leave decreased among health care workers, while engagement increased. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Thrall in this issue.",

    "title": "The Future Role of Abdominal US in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surveillance.",
    "abstract": "Abdominal US is currently the best-validated surveillance strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in at-risk patients. It is the only modality shown to have completed all five phases of validation and can achieve high sensitivity and specificity for HCC detection, especially when conducted by expert sonographers in high-volume centers. However, US also has limitations, including operator dependency and varying sensitivity in clinical practice. Further, the sensitivity of US for early-stage HCC detection is lower in patients with obesity or nonviral liver disease, increasingly common populations undergoing surveillance. Imaging-based and blood-based surveillance strategies, including abbreviated MRI and biomarker panels, may overcome some limitations of US-based surveillance. Both strategies have promising test performance in phase II and phase III biomarker studies and are undergoing prospective validation. Considering the variation in HCC risk and test performance between patients, there will likely be a shift away from a one-size-fits-all approach and toward precision screening, in which the \"best\" test is selected based on individual patient characteristics. In this upcoming era of precision HCC screening among patients with cirrhosis, US will likely continue to have an important, albeit reduced, surveillance role.",

    "abstract": "Background MR elastography (MRE) has been shown to have excellent performance for noninvasive liver fibrosis staging. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the precision and test-retest repeatability of stiffness measurement with MRE in the multicenter setting. Purpose To determine the precision and test-retest repeatability of stiffness measurement with MRE across multiple centers using the same phantoms. Materials and Methods In this study, three cylindrical phantoms made of polyvinyl chloride gel mimicking different degrees of liver stiffness in humans (phantoms 1-3: soft, medium, and hard stiffness, respectively) were evaluated. Between January 2021 and January 2022, phantoms were circulated between five different centers and scanned with 10 MRE-equipped clinical 1.5-T and 3-T systems from three major vendors, using two-dimensional (2D) gradient-recalled echo (GRE) imaging and/or 2D spin-echo (SE) echo-planar imaging (EPI). Similar MRE acquisition parameters, hardware, and reconstruction algorithms were used at each center. Mean stiffness was measured by a single observer for each phantom and acquisition on a single section. Stiffness measurement precision and same-session test-retest repeatability were assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV) and the repeatability coefficient (RC), respectively. Results The mean precision represented by the CV was 5.8% (95% CI: 3.8, 7.7) for all phantoms and both sequences combined. For all phantoms, 2D GRE achieved a CV of 4.5% (95% CI: 3.3, 5.7) whereas 2D SE EPI achieved a CV of 7.8% (95% CI: 3.1, 12.6). The mean RC of stiffness measurement was 5.8% (95% CI: 3.7, 7.8) for all phantoms and both sequences combined, 4.9% (95% CI: 2.7, 7.0) for 2D GRE, and 7.0% (95% CI: 2.9, 11.2) for 2D SE EPI (all phantoms). Conclusion MRE had excellent in vitro precision and same-session test-retest repeatability in the multicenter setting when similar imaging protocols, hardware, and reconstruction algorithms were used. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Deep Learning Assessment of Small Renal Masses at Contrast-enhanced Multiphase CT.",
    "abstract": "Background Accurate characterization of suspicious small renal masses is crucial for optimized management. Deep learning (DL) algorithms may assist with this effort. Purpose To develop and validate a DL algorithm for identifying benign small renal masses at contrast-enhanced multiphase CT. Materials and Methods Surgically resected renal masses measuring 3 cm or less in diameter at contrast-enhanced CT were included. The DL algorithm was developed by using retrospective data from one hospital between 2009 and 2021, with patients randomly allocated in a training and internal test set ratio of 8:2. Between 2013 and 2021, external testing was performed on data from five independent hospitals. A prospective test set was obtained between 2021 and 2022 from one hospital. Algorithm performance was evaluated by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared with the results of seven clinicians using the DeLong test. Results A total of 1703 patients (mean age, 56 years ± 12 [SD]; 619 female) with a single renal mass per patient were evaluated. The retrospective data set included 1063 lesions (874 in training set, 189 internal test set); the multicenter external test set included 537 lesions (12.3%, 66 benign) with 89 subcentimeter (≤1 cm) lesions (16.6%); and the prospective test set included 103 lesions (13.6%, 14 benign) with 20 (19.4%) subcentimeter lesions. The DL algorithm performance was comparable with that of urological radiologists: for the external test set, AUC was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.85) versus 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.88) (P = .61); for the prospective test set, AUC was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.93) versus 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.96) (P = .70). For subcentimeter lesions in the external test set, the algorithm and urological radiologists had similar AUC of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.83) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.92) (P = .78), respectively. Conclusion The multiphase CT-based DL algorithm showed comparable performance with that of radiologists for identifying benign small renal masses, including lesions of 1 cm or less.

    "abstract": "Background Cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS), a complication following medulloblastoma surgery, has been linked to dentato-thalamo-cortical tract (DTCT) injury; the association of the degree of DTCT injury with severity of CMS-related symptoms has not been investigated. Purpose To investigate the association between severity of CMS-related symptoms and degree and patterns of DTCT injury with use of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and if laterality of injury influences neurologic symptoms. Materials and Methods This retrospective case-control study used prospectively collected clinical and DTI data on patients with medulloblastoma enrolled in a clinical trial (between July 2016 and February 2020) and healthy controls (between April and November 2017), matched with the age range of the participants with medulloblastoma. CMS was divided into types 1 (CMS1) and 2 (CMS2). Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between CMS likelihood and DTCT injury. Results Overall, 82 participants with medulloblastoma (mean age, 11.0 years ± 5.2 [SD]; 53 male) and 35 healthy controls (mean age, 18.0 years ± 3.06; 18 female) were included. In participants with medulloblastoma, DTCT was absent bilaterally (AB), absent on the right side (AR), absent on the left side (AL), or present bilaterally (PB), while it was PB in all healthy controls. Odds of having CMS were associated with higher degree of DTCT damage (AB, odds ratio = 272.7 [95% CI: 269.68, 275.75; P < .001]; AR, odds ratio = 14.40 [95% CI: 2.84, 101.48; P < .001]; and AL, odds ratio = 8.55 [95% CI: 1.15, 74.14; P < .001). Left (coefficient = -0.07, χ2 = 12.4, P < .001) and right (coefficient = -0.15, χ2 = 33.82, P < .001) DTCT volumes were negatively associated with the odds of CMS. More participants with medulloblastoma with AB showed CMS1; unilateral DTCT absence prevailed in CMS2. Lower DTCT volumes correlated with more severe ataxia. Unilateral DTCT injury caused ipsilateral dysmetria; AB caused symmetric dysmetria. PB indicated better neurologic outcome. Conclusion The severity of CMS-associated mutism, ataxia, and dysmetria was associated with DTCT damage severity. DTCT damage patterns differed between CMS1 and CMS2. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article. See also the editorial by Dorigatti Soldatelli and Ertl-Wagner in this issue.",

    "title": "Evaluating GPT-V4 (GPT-4 with Vision) on Detection of Radiologic Findings on Chest Radiographs.",
    "abstract": "Background Generating radiologic findings from chest radiographs is pivotal in medical image analysis. The emergence of OpenAI's generative pretrained transformer, GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V), has opened new perspectives on the potential for automated image-text pair generation. However, the application of GPT-4V to real-world chest radiography is yet to be thoroughly examined. Purpose To investigate the capability of GPT-4V to generate radiologic findings from real-world chest radiographs. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 100 chest radiographs with free-text radiology reports were annotated by a cohort of radiologists, two attending physicians and three residents, to establish a reference standard. Of 100 chest radiographs, 50 were randomly selected from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) chest radiographic data set, and 50 were randomly selected from the Medical Imaging and Data Resource Center (MIDRC). The performance of GPT-4V at detecting imaging findings from each chest radiograph was assessed in the zero-shot setting (where it operates without prior examples) and few-shot setting (where it operates with two examples). Its outcomes were compared with the reference standard with regards to clinical conditions and their corresponding codes in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), including the anatomic location (hereafter, laterality). Results In the zero-shot setting, in the task of detecting ICD-10 codes alone, GPT-4V attained an average positive predictive value (PPV) of 12.3%, average true-positive rate (TPR) of 5.8%, and average F1 score of 7.3% on the NIH data set, and an average PPV of 25.0%, average TPR of 16.8%, and average F1 score of 18.2% on the MIDRC data set. When both the ICD-10 codes and their corresponding laterality were considered, GPT-4V produced an average PPV of 7.8%, average TPR of 3.5%, and average F1 score of 4.5% on the NIH data set, and an average PPV of 10.9%, average TPR of 4.9%, and average F1 score of 6.4% on the MIDRC data set. With few-shot learning, GPT-4V showed improved performance on both data sets. When contrasting zero-shot and few-shot learning, there were improved average TPRs and F1 scores in the few-shot setting, but there was not a substantial increase in the average PPV. Conclusion Although GPT-4V has shown promise in understanding natural images, it had limited effectiveness in interpreting real-world chest radiographs. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "title": "MRI Scoring Systems for Predicting Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Mutation and Chromosome 1p/19q Codeletion in Adult-type Diffuse Glioma Lacking Contrast Enhancement.",
    "abstract": "Background According to 2021 World Health Organization criteria, adult-type diffuse gliomas include glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype; oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and 1p/19q-codeleted; and astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, even when contrast enhancement is lacking. Purpose To develop and validate simple scoring systems for predicting IDH and subsequent 1p/19q codeletion status in gliomas without contrast enhancement using standard clinical MRI sequences. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included adult-type diffuse gliomas lacking contrast at contrast-enhanced MRI from two tertiary referral hospitals between January 2012 and April 2022 with diagnoses confirmed at pathology. IDH status was predicted primarily by using T2-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) mismatch sign, followed by 1p/19q codeletion prediction. A visual rating of MRI features, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratio, and relative cerebral blood volume was measured. Scoring systems were developed through univariable and multivariable logistic regressions and underwent calibration and discrimination, including internal and external validation. Results For the internal validation cohort, 237 patients were included (mean age, 44.4 years ± 14.4 [SD]; 136 male patients; 193 patients in IDH prediction and 163 patients in 1p/19q prediction). For the external validation cohort, 35 patients were included (46.1 years ± 15.3; 20 male patients; 28 patients in IDH prediction and 24 patients in 1p/19q prediction). The T2-FLAIR mismatch sign demonstrated 100% specificity and 100% positive predictive value for IDH mutation. IDH status prediction scoring system for tumors without mismatch sign included age, ADC ratio, and morphologic characteristics, whereas 1p/19q codeletion prediction for IDH-mutant gliomas included ADC ratio, cortical involvement, and mismatch sign. For IDH status and 1p/19q codeletion prediction, bootstrap-corrected areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.90) and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.81), respectively, whereas at external validation they were 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.0) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.0). Conclusion The T2-FLAIR mismatch sign and scoring systems using standard clinical MRI predicted IDH and 1p/19q codeletion status in gliomas lacking contrast enhancement. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Evaluation of a Cascaded Deep Learning-based Algorithm for Prostate Lesion Detection at Biparametric MRI.",
    "abstract": "Background Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) improves prostate cancer (PCa) detection compared with systematic biopsy, but its interpretation is prone to interreader variation, which results in performance inconsistency. Artificial intelligence (AI) models can assist in mpMRI interpretation, but large training data sets and extensive model testing are required. Purpose To evaluate a biparametric MRI AI algorithm for intraprostatic lesion detection and segmentation and to compare its performance with radiologist readings and biopsy results. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis of a prospective registry included consecutive patients with suspected or known PCa who underwent mpMRI, US-guided systematic biopsy, or combined systematic and MRI/US fusion-guided biopsy between April 2019 and September 2022. All lesions were prospectively evaluated using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.1. The lesion- and participant-level performance of a previously developed cascaded deep learning algorithm was compared with histopathologic outcomes and radiologist readings using sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Results A total of 658 male participants (median age, 67 years [IQR, 61-71 years]) with 1029 MRI-visible lesions were included. At histopathologic analysis, 45% (294 of 658) of participants had lesions of International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group (GG) 2 or higher. The algorithm identified 96% (282 of 294; 95% CI: 94%, 98%) of all participants with clinically significant PCa, whereas the radiologist identified 98% (287 of 294; 95% CI: 96%, 99%; P = .23). The algorithm identified 84% (103 of 122), 96% (152 of 159), 96% (47 of 49), 95% (38 of 40), and 98% (45 of 46) of participants with ISUP GG 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 lesions, respectively. In the lesion-level analysis using radiologist ground truth, the detection sensitivity was 55% (569 of 1029; 95% CI: 52%, 58%), and the PPV was 57% (535 of 934; 95% CI: 54%, 61%). The mean number of false-positive lesions per participant was 0.61 (range, 0-3). The lesion segmentation DSC was 0.29. Conclusion The AI algorithm detected cancer-suspicious lesions on biparametric MRI scans with a performance comparable to that of an experienced radiologist. Moreover, the algorithm reliably predicted clinically significant lesions at histopathologic examination.

Purpose To evaluate the efficacy and safety of RS treatment of HCC with 90Y resin microspheres using a single-compartment MIRD model and correlate posttreatment dose with outcomes. Materials and Methods This retrospective single-center study included adult patients with HCC who underwent RS with 90Y resin microspheres between July 2014 and December 2022. Posttreatment PET/CT and dosimetry were performed. Adverse events were assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0. Per-lesion and overall response rates (ie, complete response [CR], objective response, disease control, and duration of response) were assessed at imaging using the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and overall survival (OS) was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results Among 67 patients (median age, 69 years [IQR, 63-78 years]; 54 male patients) with HCC, median tumor absorbed dose was 232 Gy (IQR, 163-405 Gy). At 3 months, per-lesion and overall (per-patient) CR was achieved in 47 (70%) and 41 (61%) of 67 patients, respectively. At 6 months (n = 46), per-lesion rates of objective response and disease control were both 94%, and per-patient rates were both 78%. A total of 88% (95% CI: 79 99) and 72% (95% CI: 58, 90) of patients had a per-lesion and overall duration of response of 1 year or greater. At 1 month, a grade 3 clinical adverse event (abdominal pain) occurred in one of 67 (1.5%) patients. Median posttreatment OS was 26 months (95% CI: 20, not reached). Disease progression at 2 years was lower in the group that received 300 Gy or more than in the group that received less than 300 Gy (17% vs 61%; P = .047), with no local progression in the former group through the end of follow-up. Conclusion Among patients with HCC who underwent RS with 90Y resin microspheres, 88% and 72% achieved a per-lesion and overall duration of response of 1 year or greater, respectively, with one grade 3 adverse event. In patients whose tumors received 300 Gy or more according to posttreatment dosimetry, a disease progression benefit was noted. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background Acute respiratory disease (ARD) events are often thought to be airway-disease related, but some may be related to quantitative interstitial abnormalities (QIAs), which are subtle parenchymal abnormalities on CT scans associated with morbidity and mortality in individuals with a smoking history. Purpose To determine whether QIA progression at CT is associated with ARD and severe ARD events in individuals with a history of smoking. Materials and Methods This secondary analysis of a prospective study included individuals with a 10 pack-years or greater smoking history recruited from multiple centers between November 2007 and July 2017. QIA progression was assessed between baseline (visit 1) and 5-year follow-up (visit 2) chest CT scans. Episodes of ARD were defined as increased cough or dyspnea lasting 48 hours and requiring antibiotics or corticosteroids, whereas severe ARD episodes were those requiring an emergency room visit or hospitalization. Episodes were recorded via questionnaires completed every 3 to 6 months. Multivariable logistic regression and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models adjusted for comorbidities (eg, emphysema, small airway disease) were used to assess the association between QIA progression and episodes between visits 1 and 2 (intercurrent) and after visit 2 (subsequent). Results A total of 3972 participants (mean age at baseline, 60.7 years ± 8.6 [SD]; 2120 [53.4%] women) were included. Annual percentage QIA progression was associated with increased odds of one or more intercurrent (odds ratio [OR] = 1.29 [95% CI: 1.06, 1.56]; P = .01) and subsequent (OR = 1.26 [95% CI: 1.05, 1.52]; P = .02) severe ARD events. Participants in the highest quartile of QIA progression (≥1.2%) had more frequent intercurrent ARD (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.46 [95% CI: 1.14, 1.86]; P = .003) and severe ARD (IRR = 1.79 [95% CI: 1.18, 2.73]; P = .006) events than those in the lowest quartile (≤-1.7%). Conclusion QIA progression was independently associated with higher odds of severe ARD events during and after radiographic progression, with higher frequency of intercurrent severe events in those with faster progression.

    "abstract": "Background Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is often inadequate for screening women with a personal history of breast cancer (PHBC). The ongoing prospective Tomosynthesis or Contrast-Enhanced Mammography, or TOCEM, trial includes three annual screenings with both DBT and contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM). Purpose To perform interim assessment of cancer yield, stage, and recall rate when CEM is added to DBT in women with PHBC. Materials and Methods From October 2019 to December 2022, two radiologists interpreted both examinations: Observer 1 reviewed DBT first and then CEM, and observer 2 reviewed CEM first and then DBT. Effects of adding CEM to DBT on incremental cancer detection rate (ICDR), cancer type and node status, recall rate, and other performance characteristics of the primary radiologist decisions were assessed. Results Among the participants (mean age at entry, 63.6 years ± 9.6 [SD]), 1273, 819, and 227 women with PHBC completed year 1, 2, and 3 screening, respectively. For observer 1, year 1 cancer yield was 20 of 1273 (15.7 per 1000 screenings) for DBT and 29 of 1273 (22.8 per 1000 screenings; ICDR, 7.1 per 1000 screenings [95% CI: 3.2, 13.4]) for DBT plus CEM (P < .001). Year 2 plus 3 cancer yield was four of 1046 (3.8 per 1000 screenings) for DBT and eight of 1046 (7.6 per 1000 screenings; ICDR, 3.8 per 1000 screenings [95% CI: 1.0, 7.6]) for DBT plus CEM (P = .001). Year 1 recall rate for observer 1 was 103 of 1273 (8.1%) for (incidence) DBT alone and 187 of 1273 (14.7%) for DBT plus CEM (difference = 84 of 1273, 6.6% [95% CI: 5.3, 8.1]; P < .001). Year 2 plus 3 recall rate was 40 of 1046 (3.8%) for DBT and 92 of 1046 (8.8%) for DBT plus CEM (difference = 52 of 1046, 5.0% [95% CI: 3.7, 6.3]; P < .001). In 18 breasts with cancer detected only at CEM after integration of both observers, 13 (72%) cancers were invasive (median tumor size, 0.6 cm) and eight of nine (88%) with staging were N0. Among 1883 screenings with adequate reference standard, there were three interval cancers (one at the scar, two in axillae). Conclusion CEM added to DBT increased early breast cancer detection each year in women with PHBC, with an accompanying approximately 5.0%-6.6% recall rate increase. Clinical trial registration no.

    "abstract": "Background Commonly used pediatric lower extremity growth standards are based on small, dated data sets. Artificial intelligence (AI) enables creation of updated growth standards. Purpose To train an AI model using standing slot-scanning radiographs in a racially diverse data set of pediatric patients to measure lower extremity length and to compare expected growth curves derived using AI measurements to those of the conventional Anderson-Green method. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included pediatric patients aged 0-21 years who underwent at least two slot-scanning radiographs in routine clinical care between August 2015 and February 2022. A Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network was trained to segment the femur and tibia on radiographs and measure total leg, femoral, and tibial length; accuracy was assessed with mean absolute error. AI measurements were used to create quantile polynomial regression femoral and tibial growth curves, which were compared with the growth curves of the Anderson-Green method for coverage based on the central 90% of the estimated growth distribution. Results In total, 1874 examinations in 523 patients (mean age, 12.7 years ± 2.8 [SD]; 349 female patients) were included; 40% of patients self-identified as White and not Hispanic or Latino, and the remaining 60% self-identified as belonging to a different racial or ethnic group. The AI measurement training, validation, and internal test sets included 114, 25, and 64 examinations, respectively. The mean absolute errors of AI measurements of the femur, tibia, and lower extremity in the test data set were 0.25, 0.27, and 0.33 cm, respectively. All 1874 examinations were used to generate growth curves. AI growth curves more accurately represented lower extremity growth in an external test set (n = 154 examinations) than the Anderson-Green method (90% coverage probability: 86.7% [95% CI: 82.9, 90.5] for AI model vs 73.4% [95% CI: 68.4, 78.3] for Anderson-Green method; χ2 test, P < .001). Conclusion Lower extremity growth curves derived from AI measurements on standing slot-scanning radiographs from a diverse pediatric data set enabled more accurate prediction of pediatric growth. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "title": "BI-RADS Category Assignments by GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google Bard: A Multilanguage Study.",
    "abstract": "Background The performance of publicly available large language models (LLMs) remains unclear for complex clinical tasks. Purpose To evaluate the agreement between human readers and LLMs for Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories assigned based on breast imaging reports written in three languages and to assess the impact of discordant category assignments on clinical management. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included reports for women who underwent MRI, mammography, and/or US for breast cancer screening or diagnostic purposes at three referral centers. Reports with findings categorized as BI-RADS 1-5 and written in Italian, English, or Dutch were collected between January 2000 and October 2023. Board-certified breast radiologists and the LLMs GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (OpenAI) and Bard, now called Gemini (Google), assigned BI-RADS categories using only the findings described by the original radiologists. Agreement between human readers and LLMs for BI-RADS categories was assessed using the Gwet agreement coefficient (AC1 value). Frequencies were calculated for changes in BI-RADS category assignments that would affect clinical management (ie, BI-RADS 0 vs BI-RADS 1 or 2 vs BI-RADS 3 vs BI-RADS 4 or 5) and compared using the McNemar test. Results Across 2400 reports, agreement between the original and reviewing radiologists was almost perfect (AC1 = 0.91), while agreement between the original radiologists and GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Bard was moderate (AC1 = 0.52, 0.48, and 0.42, respectively). Across human readers and LLMs, differences were observed in the frequency of BI-RADS category upgrades or downgrades that would result in changed clinical management (118 of 2400 [4.9%] for human readers, 611 of 2400 [25.5%] for Bard, 573 of 2400 [23.9%] for GPT-3.5, and 435 of 2400 [18.1%] for GPT-4; P < .001) and that would negatively impact clinical management (37 of 2400 [1.5%] for human readers, 435 of 2400 [18.1%] for Bard, 344 of 2400 [14.3%] for GPT-3.5, and 255 of 2400 [10.6%] for GPT-4; P < .001). Conclusion LLMs achieved moderate agreement with human reader-assigned BI-RADS categories across reports written in three languages but also yielded a high percentage of discordant BI-RADS categories that would negatively impact clinical management. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Cryptogenic stroke refers to a stroke of undetermined etiology. It accounts for approximately one-fifth of ischemic strokes and has a higher prevalence in younger patients. Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) refers to a subgroup of patients with nonlacunar cryptogenic strokes in whom embolism is the suspected stroke mechanism. Under the classifications of cryptogenic stroke or ESUS, there is wide heterogeneity in possible stroke mechanisms. In the absence of a confirmed stroke etiology, there is no established treatment for secondary prevention of stroke in patients experiencing cryptogenic stroke or ESUS, despite several clinical trials, leaving physicians with a clinical dilemma. Both conventional and advanced MRI techniques are available in clinical practice to identify differentiating features and stroke patterns and to determine or infer the underlying etiologic cause, such as atherosclerotic plaques and cardiogenic or paradoxical embolism due to occult pelvic venous thrombi. The aim of this review is to highlight the diagnostic utility of various MRI techniques in patients with cryptogenic stroke or ESUS. Future trends in technological advancement for promoting the adoption of MRI in such a special clinical application are also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Climate change adversely affects the well-being of humans and the entire planet. A planetary health framework recognizes that sustaining a healthy planet is essential to achieving individual, community, and global health. Radiology contributes to the climate crisis by generating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during the production and use of medical imaging equipment and supplies. To promote planetary health, strategies that mitigate and adapt to climate change in radiology are needed. Mitigation strategies to reduce GHG emissions include switching to renewable energy sources, refurbishing rather than replacing imaging scanners, and powering down unused scanners. Radiology departments must also build resiliency to the now unavoidable impacts of the climate crisis. Adaptation strategies include education, upgrading building infrastructure, and developing departmental sustainability dashboards to track progress in achieving sustainability goals. Shifting practices to catalyze these necessary changes in radiology requires a coordinated approach. This includes partnering with key stakeholders, providing effective communication, and prioritizing high-impact interventions. This article reviews the intersection of planetary health and radiology. Its goals are to emphasize why we should care about sustainability, showcase actions we can take to mitigate our impact, and prepare us to adapt to the effects of climate change. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Noninvasive tests can be used to screen patients with chronic liver disease for advanced liver fibrosis; however, the use of single tests may not be adequate. Purpose To construct sequential clinical algorithms that include a US deep learning (DL) model and compare their ability to predict advanced liver fibrosis with that of other noninvasive tests. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included adult patients with a history of chronic liver disease or unexplained abnormal liver function test results who underwent B-mode US of the liver between January 2014 and September 2022 at three health care facilities. A US-based DL network (FIB-Net) was trained on US images to predict whether the shear-wave elastography (SWE) value was 8.7 kPa or higher, indicative of advanced fibrosis. In the internal and external test sets, a two-step algorithm (Two-step#1) using the Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4) followed by FIB-Net and a three-step algorithm (Three-step#1) using FIB-4 followed by FIB-Net and SWE were used to simulate screening scenarios where liver stiffness measurements were not or were available, respectively. Measures of diagnostic accuracy were calculated using liver biopsy as the reference standard and compared between FIB-4, SWE, FIB-Net, and European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines (ie, FIB-4 followed by SWE), along with sequential algorithms. Results The training, validation, and test data sets included 3067 (median age, 42 years [IQR, 33-53 years]; 2083 male), 1599 (median age, 41 years [IQR, 33-51 years]; 1124 male), and 1228 (median age, 44 years [IQR, 33-55 years]; 741 male) patients, respectively. FIB-Net obtained a noninferior specificity with a margin of 5% (P < .001) compared with SWE (80% vs 82%). The Two-step#1 algorithm showed higher specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) than FIB-4 (specificity, 79% vs 57%; PPV, 44% vs 32%) while reducing unnecessary referrals by 42%. The Three-step#1 algorithm had higher specificity and PPV compared with European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines (specificity, 94% vs 88%; PPV, 73% vs 64%) while reducing unnecessary referrals by 35%. Conclusion A sequential algorithm combining FIB-4 and a US DL model showed higher diagnostic accuracy and improved referral management for all-cause advanced liver fibrosis compared with FIB-4 or the DL model alone. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have augmented the capabilities of MRI, which has led to their widespread and increasing use in radiology practice. GBCAs are introduced into the environment through disposal of unused product and elimination after intravenous injection, both primarily via liquid dispersion into the environment. This human introduction of gadolinium into the environment, referred to as anthropogenic gadolinium, is associated with the detection of gadolinium in water systems, raising concerns for potential adverse impact and prompting certain mitigation actions. This article summarizes the existing knowledge and problem scope, conveys the relevant underlying chemical principles of chelate dissociation, and offers an inferred perspective that the magnitude of the problem is most unlikely to cause human harm. The merits and limitations regarding possible mitigation tactics, such as collecting urine after GBCA administration, use of lower-dose high-relaxivity macrocyclic GBCAs, and the option for virtual contrast-enhanced examinations, will be discussed. Finally, the potential for monitoring gadolinium uptake in bone will be presented, and recommendations for future research will be offered. © RSNA, 2024 See also the article by Ibrahim et al in this issue.

    "title": "Potential of GPT-4 for Detecting Errors in Radiology Reports: Implications for Reporting Accuracy.",
    "abstract": "Background Errors in radiology reports may occur because of resident-to-attending discrepancies, speech recognition inaccuracies, and large workload. Large language models, such as GPT-4 (ChatGPT; OpenAI), may assist in generating reports. Purpose To assess effectiveness of GPT-4 in identifying common errors in radiology reports, focusing on performance, time, and cost-efficiency. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 200 radiology reports (radiography and cross-sectional imaging [CT and MRI]) were compiled between June 2023 and December 2023 at one institution. There were 150 errors from five common error categories (omission, insertion, spelling, side confusion, and other) intentionally inserted into 100 of the reports and used as the reference standard. Six radiologists (two senior radiologists, two attending physicians, and two residents) and GPT-4 were tasked with detecting these errors. Overall error detection performance, error detection in the five error categories, and reading time were assessed using Wald χ2 tests and paired-sample t tests. Results GPT-4 (detection rate, 82.7%;124 of 150; 95% CI: 75.8, 87.9) matched the average detection performance of radiologists independent of their experience (senior radiologists, 89.3% [134 of 150; 95% CI: 83.4, 93.3]; attending physicians, 80.0% [120 of 150; 95% CI: 72.9, 85.6]; residents, 80.0% [120 of 150; 95% CI: 72.9, 85.6]; P value range, .522-.99). One senior radiologist outperformed GPT-4 (detection rate, 94.7%; 142 of 150; 95% CI: 89.8, 97.3; P = .006). GPT-4 required less processing time per radiology report than the fastest human reader in the study (mean reading time, 3.5 seconds ± 0.5 [SD] vs 25.1 seconds ± 20.1, respectively; P < .001; Cohen d = -1.08). The use of GPT-4 resulted in lower mean correction cost per report than the most cost-efficient radiologist ($0.03 ± 0.01 vs $0.42 ± 0.41; P < .001; Cohen d = -1.12). Conclusion The radiology report error detection rate of GPT-4 was comparable with that of radiologists, potentially reducing work hours and cost. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Forman in this issue.",

    "abstract": "The diagnosis and management of chronic nonspinal osteomyelitis can be challenging, and guidelines regarding the appropriateness of performing percutaneous image-guided biopsies to acquire bone samples for microbiological analysis remain limited. An expert panel convened by the Society of Academic Bone Radiologists developed and endorsed consensus statements on the various indications for percutaneous image-guided biopsies to standardize care and eliminate inconsistencies across institutions. The issued statements pertain to several commonly encountered clinical presentations of chronic osteomyelitis and were supported by a literature review. For most patients, MRI can help guide management and effectively rule out osteomyelitis when performed soon after presentation. Additionally, in the appropriate clinical setting, open wounds such as sinus tracts and ulcers, as well as joint fluid aspirates, can be used for microbiological culture to determine the causative microorganism. If MRI findings are positive, surgery is not needed, and alternative sites for microbiological culture are not available, then percutaneous image-guided biopsies can be performed. The expert panel recommends that antibiotics be avoided or discontinued for an optimal period of 2 weeks prior to a biopsy whenever possible. Patients with extensive necrotic decubitus ulcers or other surgical emergencies should not undergo percutaneous image-guided biopsies but rather should be admitted for surgical debridement and intraoperative cultures. Multidisciplinary discussion and approach are crucial to ensure optimal diagnosis and care of patients diagnosed with chronic osteomyelitis.",

Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning (DL) prognostic model using preoperative CT scans and clinical and radiologic information for risk stratification in patients with clinical stage IA NSCLC undergoing segmentectomy. Materials and Methods In this single-center retrospective study, transfer learning of a pretrained model was performed for survival prediction in patients with clinical stage IA NSCLC who underwent lobectomy from January 2008 to March 2017. The internal set was divided into training, validation, and testing sets based on the assignments from the pretraining set. The model was tested on an independent test set of patients with clinical stage IA NSCLC who underwent segmentectomy from January 2010 to December 2017. Its prognostic performance was analyzed using the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for freedom from recurrence (FFR) at 2 and 4 years and lung cancer-specific survival and overall survival at 4 and 6 years. The model sensitivity and specificity were compared with those of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) eligibility criteria for sublobar resection. Results The pretraining set included 1756 patients. Transfer learning was performed in an internal set of 730 patients (median age, 63 years [IQR, 56-70 years]; 366 male), and the segmentectomy test set included 222 patients (median age, 65 years [IQR, 58-71 years]; 114 male). The model performance for 2-year FFR was as follows: AUC, 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.96); sensitivity, 87.4% (7.17 of 8.21 patients; 95% CI: 59.4, 100); and specificity, 66.7% (136 of 204 patients; 95% CI: 60.2, 72.8). The model showed higher sensitivity for FFR than the JCOG criteria (87.4% vs 37.6% [3.08 of 8.21 patients], P = .02), with similar specificity. Conclusion The CT-based DL model identified patients at high risk among those with clinical stage IA NSCLC who underwent segmentectomy, outperforming the JCOG criteria. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background Although favorable outcomes have been reported with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), the long-term efficacy remains insufficiently investigated. Purpose To evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of US-guided percutaneous RFA in patients with SHPT undergoing dialysis and to identify possible predictors associated with treatment failure. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive patients with SHPT with at least one enlarged parathyroid gland accessible for RFA who were undergoing dialysis at seven tertiary centers from May 2013 to July 2022. The primary end point was the proportion of patients with parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels less than or equal to 585 pg/mL at the end of follow-up. Secondary end points were the proportion of patients with normal calcium and phosphorus levels, the technical success rate, procedure-related complications, and improvement in self-rated hyperparathyroidism-related symptoms (0-3 ranking scale). The Wilcoxon signed rank test and generalized estimating equation model were used to evaluate treatment outcomes. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses identified variables associated with treatment failure (recurrent or persistent hyperparathyroidism). Results This study included 165 patients (median age, 51 years [IQR, 44-60 years]; 92 female) and 582 glands. RFA effectively reduced PTH, calcium, and phosphorus levels, with targeted ranges achieved in 78.2% (129 of 165), 72.7% (120 of 165), and 60.0% (99 of 165) of patients, respectively, at the end of follow-up (mean, 51 months). For the RFA sessions, the technical success rate was 100% (214 of 214). Median symptom scores (ostealgia, arthralgia, pruritus) decreased (all P < .001). Regarding complications, only hypocalcemia (45.8%, 98 of 214) was common. Treatment failure occurred in 36 patients (recurrent [n = 5] or persistent [n = 31] hyperparathyroidism). The only potential independent predictor of treatment failure was having less than four treated glands (odds ratio, 17.18; 95% CI: 4.34, 67.95; P < .001). Conclusion US-guided percutaneous RFA was effective and safe in the long term as a nonsurgical alternative for patients with SHPT undergoing dialysis; the only potential independent predictor of treatment failure was a lower number (<4) of treated glands. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background Procedural details of mechanical thrombectomy in patients with ischemic stroke are important predictors of clinical outcome and are collected for prospective studies or national stroke registries. To date, these data are collected manually by human readers, a labor-intensive task that is prone to errors. Purpose To evaluate the use of the large language models (LLMs) GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 to extract data from neuroradiology reports on mechanical thrombectomy in patients with ischemic stroke. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive reports from patients with ischemic stroke who underwent mechanical thrombectomy between November 2022 and September 2023 at institution 1 and between September 2016 and December 2019 at institution 2. A set of 20 reports was used to optimize the prompt, and the ability of the LLMs to extract procedural data from the reports was compared using the McNemar test. Data manually extracted by an interventional neuroradiologist served as the reference standard. Results A total of 100 internal reports from 100 patients (mean age, 74.7 years ± 13.2 [SD]; 53 female) and 30 external reports from 30 patients (mean age, 72.7 years ± 13.5; 18 male) were included. All reports were successfully processed by GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. Of 2800 data entries, 2631 (94.0% [95% CI: 93.0, 94.8]; range per category, 61%-100%) data points were correctly extracted by GPT-4 without the need for further postprocessing. With 1788 of 2800 correct data entries, GPT-3.5 produced fewer correct data entries than did GPT-4 (63.9% [95% CI: 62.0, 65.6]; range per category, 14%-99%; P < .001). For the external reports, GPT-4 extracted 760 of 840 (90.5% [95% CI: 88.3, 92.4]) correct data entries, while GPT-3.5 extracted 539 of 840 (64.2% [95% CI: 60.8, 67.4]; P < .001).

    "abstract": "Endometriosis is a prevalent and potentially debilitating condition that mostly affects individuals of reproductive age, and often has a substantial diagnostic delay. US is usually the first-line imaging modality used when patients report chronic pelvic pain or have issues of infertility, both common symptoms of endometriosis. Other than the visualization of an endometrioma, sonologists frequently do not appreciate endometriosis on routine transvaginal US images. Given a substantial body of literature describing techniques to depict endometriosis at US, the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to make recommendations aimed at improving the screening process for endometriosis. The panel was composed of experts in the imaging and management of endometriosis, including radiologists, sonographers, gynecologists, reproductive endocrinologists, and minimally invasive gynecologic surgeons. A comprehensive literature review combined with a modified Delphi technique achieved a consensus. This statement defines the targeted screening population, describes techniques for augmenting pelvic US, establishes direct and indirect observations for endometriosis at US, creates an observational grading and reporting system, and makes recommendations for additional imaging and patient management. The panel recommends transvaginal US of the posterior compartment, observation of the relative positioning of the uterus and ovaries, and the uterine sliding sign maneuver to improve the detection of endometriosis. These additional techniques can be performed in 5 minutes or less and could ultimately decrease the delay of an endometriosis diagnosis in at-risk patients.",

    "title": "Predicting Invasiveness of Lung Adenocarcinoma at Chest CT with Deep Learning Ternary Classification Models.",
    "abstract": "Background Preoperative discrimination of preinvasive, minimally invasive, and invasive adenocarcinoma at CT informs clinical management decisions but may be challenging for classifying pure ground-glass nodules (pGGNs). Deep learning (DL) may improve ternary classification. Purpose To determine whether a strategy that includes an adjudication approach can enhance the performance of DL ternary classification models in predicting the invasiveness of adenocarcinoma at chest CT and maintain performance in classifying pGGNs. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, six ternary models for classifying preinvasive, minimally invasive, and invasive adenocarcinoma were developed using a multicenter data set of lung nodules. The DL-based models were progressively modified through framework optimization, joint learning, and an adjudication strategy (simulating a multireader approach to resolving discordant nodule classifications), integrating two binary classification models with a ternary classification model to resolve discordant classifications sequentially. The six ternary models were then tested on an external data set of pGGNs imaged between December 2019 and January 2021. Diagnostic performance including accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity was assessed. The χ2 test was used to compare model performance in different subgroups stratified by clinical confounders. Results A total of 4929 nodules from 4483 patients (mean age, 50.1 years ± 9.5 [SD]; 2806 female) were divided into training (n = 3384), validation (n = 579), and internal (n = 966) test sets. A total of 361 pGGNs from 281 patients (mean age, 55.2 years ± 11.1 [SD]; 186 female) formed the external test set. The proposed strategy improved DL model performance in external testing (P < .001). For classifying minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, the accuracy was 85% and 79%, sensitivity was 75% and 63%, and specificity was 89% and 85% for the model with adjudication (model 6) and the model without (model 3), respectively. Model 6 showed a relatively narrow range (maximum minus minimum) across diagnostic indexes (accuracy, 1.7%; sensitivity, 7.3%; specificity, 0.9%) compared with the other models (accuracy, 0.6%-10.8%; sensitivity, 14%-39.1%; specificity, 5.5%-17.9%). Conclusion Combining framework optimization, joint learning, and an adjudication approach improved DL classification of adenocarcinoma invasiveness at chest CT. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

    "abstract": "Background The Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound (SRU) has proposed thresholds for acoustic radiation force impulse techniques to diagnose compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD). However, the diagnostic performance of these thresholds has not been extensively validated. Purpose To validate the SRU thresholds in patients with chronic liver disease who underwent supersonic shear imaging and, if suboptimal diagnostic performance is observed, to identify optimal values for diagnosing cACLD. Materials and Methods This retrospective single-center study included high-risk patients with chronic liver disease who had liver stiffness (LS) measurements and had undergone endoscopy or liver biopsy between January 2018 and December 2021. Patients were randomly allocated to test and validation sets. cACLD was defined as varices at endoscopy and/or severe fibrosis or cirrhosis at liver biopsy. The diagnostic performance of the SRU guidelines was evaluated, and optimal threshold values were identified using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results A total of 1180 patients (median age, 57 years [IQR, 50-64 years]; 761 men), of whom 544 (46%) had cACLD, were included. With the SRU recommended thresholds of less than 9 kPa and greater than 13 kPa in the test set (n = 786), the sensitivity and specificity for ruling out and ruling in cACLD were 81% (303 of 374 patients; 95% CI: 77, 85) and 92% (380 of 412 patients; 95% CI: 89, 94), respectively. In ROC curve analysis, the identified optimal threshold values were less than 7 kPa and greater than 12 kPa, showing 91% sensitivity (340 of 374 patients; 95% CI: 88, 93) for ruling out cACLD and 91% specificity (373 of 412 patients; 95% CI: 87, 93) for ruling in cACLD, respectively. In the validation set (n = 394), the optimal thresholds showed 91% sensitivity (155 of 170 patients; 95% CI: 86, 95) and 92% specificity (206 of 224 patients; 95% CI: 88, 95). Conclusion Compared with the SRU guidelines, the dual LS threshold values of less than 7 kPa and greater than 12 kPa were better for diagnosing cACLD. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Mammographic density measurements are used to identify patients who should undergo supplemental imaging for breast cancer detection, but artificial intelligence (AI) image analysis may be more effective. Purpose To assess whether AISmartDensity-an AI-based score integrating cancer signs, masking, and risk-surpasses measurements of mammographic density in identifying patients for supplemental breast imaging after a negative screening mammogram. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included randomly selected individuals who underwent screening mammography at Karolinska University Hospital between January 2008 and December 2015. The models in AISmartDensity were trained and validated using nonoverlapping data. The ability of AISmartDensity to identify future cancer in patients with a negative screening mammogram was evaluated and compared with that of mammographic density models. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated for the top 8% of scores, mimicking the proportion of patients in the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System \"extremely dense\" category. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and was compared using the DeLong test. Results The study population included 65 325 examinations (median patient age, 53 years [IQR, 47-62 years])-64 870 examinations in healthy patients and 455 examinations in patients with breast cancer diagnosed within 3 years of a negative screening mammogram. The AUC for detecting subsequent cancers was 0.72 and 0.61 (P < .001) for AISmartDensity and the best-performing density model (age-adjusted dense area), respectively. For examinations with scores in the top 8%, AISmartDensity identified 152 of 455 (33%) future cancers with a PPV of 2.91%, whereas the best-performing density model (age-adjusted dense area) identified 57 of 455 (13%) future cancers with a PPV of 1.09% (P < .001). AISmartDensity identified 32% (41 of 130) and 34% (111 of 325) of interval and next-round screen-detected cancers, whereas the best-performing density model (dense area) identified 16% (21 of 130) and 9% (30 of 325), respectively. Conclusion AISmartDensity, integrating cancer signs, masking, and risk, outperformed traditional density models in identifying patients for supplemental imaging after a negative screening mammogram. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background The increasing use of teleradiology has been accompanied by concerns relating to risk management and patient safety. Purpose To compare characteristics of teleradiology and nonteleradiology radiology malpractice cases and identify contributing factors underlying these cases. Materials and Methods In this retrospective analysis, a national database of medical malpractice cases was queried to identify cases involving telemedicine that closed between January 2010 and March 2022. Teleradiology malpractice cases were identified based on manual review of cases in which telemedicine was coded as one of the contributing factors. These cases were compared with nonteleradiology cases that closed during the same time period in which radiology had been determined to be the primary responsible clinical service. Claimant, clinical, and financial characteristics of the cases were recorded, and continuous or categorical data were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Fisher exact test, respectively. Results This study included 135 teleradiology and 3474 radiology malpractices cases. The death of a patient occurred more frequently in teleradiology cases (48 of 135 [35.6%]) than in radiology cases (685 of 3474 [19.7%]; P < .001). Cerebrovascular disease was a more common final diagnosis in the teleradiology cases (13 of 135 [9.6%]) compared with the radiology cases (124 of 3474 [3.6%]; P = .002). Problems with communication among providers was a more frequent contributing factor in the teleradiology cases (35 of 135 [25.9%]) than in the radiology cases (439 of 3474 [12.6%]; P < .001). Teleradiology cases were more likely to close with indemnity payment (79 of 135 [58.5%]) than the radiology cases (1416 of 3474 [40.8%]; P < .001) and had a higher median indemnity payment than the radiology cases ($339 230 [IQR, $120 790-$731 615] vs $214 063 [IQR, $66 620-$585 424]; P = .01). Conclusion Compared with radiology cases, teleradiology cases had higher clinical and financial severity and were more likely to involve issues with communication. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Mezrich in this issue.",

    "abstract": "Background Microwave ablation (MWA) is currently under preliminary investigation for the treatment of multifocal papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and has shown promising treatment efficacy. Compared with surgical resection (SR), MWA is minimally invasive and could preserve thyroid function. However, a comparative analysis between MWA and SR is warranted to draw definitive conclusions. Purpose To compare MWA and SR for preoperative US-detected T1N0M0 multifocal PTC in terms of overall and 1-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival rates and complication rates. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 775 patients with preoperative US-detected T1N0M0 multifocal PTC treated with MWA or SR across 10 centers between May 2015 and December 2021 were included. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed for patients in the MWA and SR groups, followed by comparisons between the two groups. The primary outcomes were overall and 1-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates and complication rates. Results After PSM, 229 patients (median age, 44 years [IQR 36.5-50.5 years]; 179 female) in the MWA group and 453 patients (median age, 45 years [IQR 37-53 years]; 367 female) in the SR group were observed for a median of 20 months (range, 12-74 months) and 26 months (range, 12-64 months), respectively. MWA resulted in less blood loss, shorter incision length, and shorter procedure and hospitalization durations (all P < .001). There was no evidence of differences in overall and 1-, 3-, or 5-year PFS rates (all P > .05) between MWA and SR (5-year rate, 77.2% vs 83.1%; P = .36) groups. Permanent hoarseness (2.2%, P = .05) and hypoparathyroidism (4.0%, P = .005) were encountered only in the SR group. Conclusion There was no evidence of a significant difference in PFS rates between MWA and SR for US-detected multifocal T1N0M0 PTC, and MWA resulted in fewer complications. Therefore, MWA is a feasible option for selected patients with multifocal T1N0M0 PTC. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Noninvasive diagnostic guidelines for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) vary across different global geographic areas, especially regarding criteria about gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of four different international HCC diagnosis guidelines and readers' judgment in diagnosing HCC using gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in patients at high risk for HCC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients who had not undergone treatment, were at risk for HCC, and who underwent gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI from January 2015 to June 2018 from 11 tertiary hospitals in South Korea. Four radiologists independently reviewed focal liver lesions (FLLs) according to four guidelines: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)/Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS), Korean Liver Cancer Association-National Cancer Center (KLCA-NCC), European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL). Reader judgment (HCC or not HCC) was also recorded. Malignant FLLs were confirmed at pathology, and histologic and clinical follow-up data were used for benign FLLs. The guidelines' diagnostic performance was compared using generalized estimating equations. Additionally, the diagnostic odds ratio was assessed. Results A total of 2445 FLLs (median size, 27.4 mm) were analyzed in 2237 patients (mean age, 59 years ± 11 [SD]; 1666 male patients); 69.3% (1694 of 2445) were HCCs. KLCA-NCC showed the highest accuracy (80.0%; 95% CI: 78.7, 81.2; P = .001), with high sensitivity in Eastern guidelines (APASL, 89.1% [95% CI: 87.8, 90.3]; KLCA-NCC, 78.2% [95% CI: 76.6, 79.7]) and high specificity in Western guidelines (AASLD/LI-RADS, 89.6% [95% CI: 87.8, 91.2]; EASL, 88.1% [95% CI: 86.2, 89.9]) (P = .001). The diagnostic odds ratios were 20.7 (95% CI: 17.0, 25.3) for AASLD/LI-RADS, 18.9 (95% CI: 15.8, 22.6) for KLCA-NCC, 16.8 (95% CI: 13.8, 20.4) for EASL, and 8.9 (95% CI: 7.4, 10.7) for APASL. The readers' judgment demonstrated higher accuracy than that of the guidelines (accuracy, 86.0%; 95% CI: 84.9, 86.9; P = .001). Conclusion Among four different international HCC diagnosis guidelines, Eastern guidelines demonstrated higher sensitivity, whereas Western guidelines displayed higher specificity. KLCA-NCC achieved the highest accuracy, and AASLD/LI-RADS exhibited the highest diagnostic odds ratio. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

Purpose To apply automated segmentation to UK Biobank cardiac MRI scans to (a) assess the association between individual characteristics and CV risk factors and trabeculated LV mass (LVM) and (b) establish normal reference ranges in a selected group of healthy UK Biobank participants. Materials and Methods In this cross-sectional secondary analysis, prospectively collected data from the UK Biobank (2006 to 2010) were retrospectively analyzed. Automated segmentation of trabeculations was performed using a deep learning algorithm. After excluding individuals with known CV diseases, White adults without CV risk factors (reference group) and those with preexisting CV risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, or smoking) (exposed group) were compared. Multivariable regression models, adjusted for potential confounders (age, sex, and height), were fitted to evaluate the associations between individual characteristics and CV risk factors and trabeculated LVM. Results Of 43 038 participants (mean age, 64 years ± 8 [SD]; 22 360 women), 28 672 individuals (mean age, 66 years ± 7; 14 918 men) were included in the exposed group, and 7384 individuals (mean age, 60 years ± 7; 4729 women) were included in the reference group. Higher body mass index (BMI) (β = 0.66 [95% CI: 0.63, 0.68]; P < .001), hypertension (β = 0.42 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.48]; P < .001), and higher physical activity level (β = 0.15 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.17]; P < .001) were associated with higher trabeculated LVM. In the reference group, the median trabeculated LVM was 6.3 g (IQR, 4.7-8.5 g) for men and 4.6 g (IQR, 3.4-6.0 g) for women. Median trabeculated LVM decreased with age for men from 6.5 g (IQR, 4.8-8.7 g) at age 45-50 years to 5.9 g (IQR, 4.3-7.8 g) at age 71-80 years (P = .03). Conclusion Higher trabeculated LVM was observed with hypertension, higher BMI, and higher physical activity level. Age- and sex-specific reference ranges of trabeculated LVM in a healthy middle-aged White population were established. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Abbreviated Breast MRI: State of the Art.",
    "abstract": "Abbreviated MRI is an umbrella term, defined as a focused MRI examination tailored to answer a single specific clinical question. For abbreviated breast MRI, this question is: \"Is there evidence of breast cancer?\" Abbreviated MRI of the breast makes maximum use of the fact that the kinetics of breast cancers and of benign tissue differ most in the very early postcontrast phase; therefore, abbreviated breast MRI focuses on this period. The different published approaches to abbreviated MRI include the following three subtypes: (a) short protocols, consisting of a precontrast and either a single postcontrast acquisition (first postcontrast subtracted [FAST]) or a time-resolved series of postcontrast acquisitions with lower spatial resolution (ultrafast [UF]), obtained during the early postcontrast phase immediately after contrast agent injection; (b) abridged protocols, consisting of FAST or UF acquisitions plus selected additional pulse sequences; and (c) noncontrast protocols, where diffusion-weighted imaging replaces the contrast information. Abbreviated MRI was proposed to increase tolerability of and access to breast MRI as a screening tool. But its widening application now includes follow-up after breast cancer and even diagnostic assessment. This review defines the three subtypes of abbreviated MRI, highlighting the differences between the protocols and their clinical implications and summarizing the respective evidence on diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "Background Detection of extranodal extension (ENE) at pathology is a poor prognostic indicator for rectal cancer, but whether ENE can be identified at pretreatment MRI is, to the knowledge of the authors, unknown. Purpose To evaluate the performance of pretreatment MRI in detecting ENE using a matched pathologic reference standard and to assess its prognostic value in patients with rectal cancer. Materials and Methods This single-center study included a prospective development data set consisting of participants with rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent pretreatment MRI and radical surgery (December 2021 to January 2023). MRI characteristics were identified by their association with ENE-positive nodes (χ2 test and multivariable logistic regression) and the performance of these MRI features was assessed (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]). Interobserver agreement was assessed by Cohen κ coefficient. The prognostic value of ENE detected with MRI for predicting 3-year disease-free survival was assessed by Cox regression analysis in a retrospective independent validation cohort of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (December 2019 to July 2020). Results The development data set included 147 participants (mean age, 62 years ± 11 [SD]; 87 male participants). The retrospective cohort included 110 patients (mean age, 60 years ± 9; 79 male participants). Presence of vessel interruption and fusion (both P < .001), heterogeneous internal structure, and the broken-ring and tail signs (odds ratio range, 4.10-23.20; P value range, <.001 to .002) were predictors of ENE at MRI, and together achieved an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88, 0.93) in detecting ENE. Interobserver agreement was moderate for the presence of vessel interruption and fusion (κ = 0.46 for both) and substantial for others (κ = 0.61-0.67). The presence of ENE at pretreatment MRI was independently associated with worse 3-year disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 3.00; P = .02). Conclusion ENE can be detected at pretreatment MRI, and its presence was associated with worse prognosis for patients with rectal cancer. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) for coronary artery disease requires true noncontrast (TNC) CT alongside contrast-enhanced coronary CT angiography (CCTA). Photon-counting CT provides an algorithm (PureCalcium) for reconstructing virtual noncontrast images from CCTA specifically for CACS. Purpose To assess CACS differences based on PureCalcium images derived from contrast-enhanced photon-counting CCTA compared with TNC images and evaluate the impact of these differences on the clinically relevant classification of patients into plaque burden groups. Materials and Methods Photon-counting CCTA images acquired between August 2022 and May 2023 were retrospectively identified. Agatston scores were derived from both TNC and PureCalcium images and tested for differences with use of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The agreement was assessed with use of equivalence tests, Bland-Altman analysis, and intraclass correlation coefficient. Plaque burden groups were established based on Agatston scores, and agreement was evaluated using weighted Cohen kappa. The dose-length product was analyzed. Results Among 170 patients (mean age, 63 years ± 13 [SD]; 92 male), 111 had Agatston scores higher than 0. Median Agatston scores did not differ between TNC and PureCalcium images (4.8 [IQR, 0-84.4; range, 0.0-2151.8] vs 2.7 [IQR, 0-90.7; range, 0.0-2377.1]; P = .99), with strong correlation (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.98 [95% CI: 0.97, 0.99]). The equivalence test was inconclusive, with a 95% CI of 0.90, 1.19. Bland-Altman analysis showed wide repeatability limits, indicating low agreement between the two scores. With use of the PureCalcium algorithm, 125 of 170 patients (74%) were correctly classified into plaque burden groups (excellent agreement, κ = 0.88). Patients without plaque burden were misclassified at higher than normal rates (P < .001). TNC image acquisition contributed a mean of 19.7% ± 8.8 of the radiation dose of the entire examination. Conclusion PureCalcium images show potential to replace TNC images for measuring Agatston scores, thereby reducing radiation dose in CCTA. There was strong correlation in calcium scores between TNC and PureCalcium, but limited agreement. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Differentiating between benign and malignant vertebral fractures poses diagnostic challenges. Purpose To investigate the reliability of CT-based deep learning models to differentiate between benign and malignant vertebral fractures. Materials and Methods CT scans acquired in patients with benign or malignant vertebral fractures from June 2005 to December 2022 at two university hospitals were retrospectively identified based on a composite reference standard that included histopathologic and radiologic information. An internal test set was randomly selected, and an external test set was obtained from an additional hospital. Models used a three-dimensional U-Net encoder-classifier architecture and applied data augmentation during training. Performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared with that of two residents and one fellowship-trained radiologist using the DeLong test. Results The training set included 381 patients (mean age, 69.9 years ± 11.4 [SD]; 193 male) with 1307 vertebrae (378 benign fractures, 447 malignant fractures, 482 malignant lesions). Internal and external test sets included 86 (mean age, 66.9 years ± 12; 45 male) and 65 (mean age, 68.8 years ± 12.5; 39 female) patients, respectively. The better-performing model of two training approaches achieved AUCs of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.92) in the internal and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.85) in the external test sets. Including an uncertainty category further improved performance to AUCs of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.97) in the internal test set and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.88) in the external test set. The AUC values of residents were lower than that of the best-performing model in the internal test set (AUC, 0.69 [95% CI: 0.59, 0.78] and 0.71 [95% CI: 0.61, 0.80]) and external test set (AUC, 0.70 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.80] and 0.71 [95% CI: 0.60, 0.82]), with significant differences only for the internal test set (P < .001). The AUCs of the fellowship-trained radiologist were similar to those of the best-performing model (internal test set, 0.86 [95% CI: 0.78, 0.93; P = .39]; external test set, 0.71 [95% CI: 0.60, 0.82; P = .46]).

    "title": "Quantitative Evaluation of Large Language Models to Streamline Radiology Report Impressions: A Multimodal Retrospective Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Background The complex medical terminology of radiology reports may cause confusion or anxiety for patients, especially given increased access to electronic health records. Large language models (LLMs) can potentially simplify radiology report readability. Purpose To compare the performance of four publicly available LLMs (ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4, Bard [now known as Gemini], and Bing) in producing simplified radiology report impressions. Materials and Methods In this retrospective comparative analysis of the four LLMs (accessed July 23 to July 26, 2023), the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database was used to gather 750 anonymized radiology report impressions covering a range of imaging modalities (MRI, CT, US, radiography, mammography) and anatomic regions. Three distinct prompts were employed to assess the LLMs' ability to simplify report impressions. The first prompt (prompt 1) was \"Simplify this radiology report.\" The second prompt (prompt 2) was \"I am a patient. Simplify this radiology report.\" The last prompt (prompt 3) was \"Simplify this radiology report at the 7th grade level.\" Each prompt was followed by the radiology report impression and was queried once. The primary outcome was simplification as assessed by readability score. Readability was assessed using the average of four established readability indexes. The nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to compare reading grade levels across LLM output. Results All four LLMs simplified radiology report impressions across all prompts tested (P < .001). Within prompts, differences were found between LLMs. Providing the context of being a patient or requesting simplification at the seventh-grade level reduced the reading grade level of output for all models and prompts (except prompt 1 to prompt 2 for ChatGPT-4) (P < .001). Conclusion Although the success of each LLM varied depending on the specific prompt wording, all four models simplified radiology report impressions across all modalities and prompts tested. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Mirai, a state-of-the-art deep learning-based algorithm for predicting short-term breast cancer risk, outperforms standard clinical risk models. However, Mirai is a black box, risking overreliance on the algorithm and incorrect diagnoses. Purpose To identify whether bilateral dissimilarity underpins Mirai's reasoning process; create a simplified, intelligible model, AsymMirai, using bilateral dissimilarity; and determine if AsymMirai may approximate Mirai's performance in 1-5-year breast cancer risk prediction. Materials and Methods This retrospective study involved mammograms obtained from patients in the EMory BrEast imaging Dataset, known as EMBED, from January 2013 to December 2020. To approximate 1-5-year breast cancer risk predictions from Mirai, another deep learning-based model, AsymMirai, was built with an interpretable module: local bilateral dissimilarity (localized differences between left and right breast tissue). Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between the risk scores of Mirai and those of AsymMirai. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients for whom AsymMirai's year-over-year reasoning was consistent. AsymMirai and Mirai risk scores were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and 95% CIs were calculated using the DeLong method. Results Screening mammograms (n = 210 067) from 81 824 patients (mean age, 59.4 years ± 11.4 [SD]) were included in the study. Deep learning-extracted bilateral dissimilarity produced similar risk scores to those of Mirai (1-year risk prediction, r = 0.6832; 4-5-year prediction, r = 0.6988) and achieved similar performance as Mirai. For AsymMirai, the 1-year breast cancer risk AUC was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.85) (Mirai, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.89; P = .002), and the 5-year risk AUC was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.69) (Mirai, 0.71; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.74; P < .001). In a subgroup of 183 patients for whom AsymMirai repeatedly highlighted the same tissue over time, AsymMirai achieved a 3-year AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.97).

    "abstract": "Background Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability change is a possible pathologic mechanism of autoimmune encephalitis. Purpose To evaluate the change in BBB permeability in patients with autoimmune encephalitis as compared with healthy controls by using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and to explore its predictive value for treatment response in patients. Materials and Methods This single-center retrospective study included consecutive patients with probable or possible autoimmune encephalitis and healthy controls who underwent DCE MRI between April 2020 and May 2021. Automatic volumetric segmentation was performed on three-dimensional T1-weighted images, and volume transfer constant (Ktrans) values were calculated at encephalitis-associated brain regions. Ktrans values were compared between the patients and controls, with adjustment for age and sex with use of a nonparametric approach. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to compare Ktrans values of the good (improvement in modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of at least two points or achievement of an mRS score of  ≤2) and poor (improvement in mRS score of less than two points and achievement of an mRS score >2) treatment response groups among the patients. Results Thirty-eight patients with autoimmune encephalitis (median age, 38 years [IQR, 29-59 years]; 20 [53%] female) and 17 controls (median age, 71 years [IQR, 63-77 years]; 12 [71%] female) were included. All brain regions showed higher Ktrans values in patients as compared with controls (P < .001). The median difference in Ktrans between the patients and controls was largest in the right parahippocampal gyrus (25.1 × 10-4 min-1 [95% CI: 17.6, 43.4]). Among patients, the poor treatment response group had higher baseline Ktrans values in both cerebellar cortices (P = .03), the left cerebellar cortex (P = .02), right cerebellar cortex (P = .045), left cerebral cortex (P = .045), and left postcentral gyrus (P = .03) than the good treatment response group. Conclusion DCE MRI demonstrated that BBB permeability was increased in all brain regions in patients with autoimmune encephalitis as compared with controls, and baseline Ktrans values were higher in patients with poor treatment response in the cerebellar cortex, left cerebral cortex, and left postcentral gyrus as compared with the good response group. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Standard-of-care abscess management includes image-guided percutaneous drainage and antibiotics; however, cure rates vary, and concern for antibiotic-resistant bacteria is growing. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses light-activated dyes to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, could complement the standard of care by sterilizing the abscess at the time of drainage. Purpose To evaluate safety and feasibility of PDT with methylene blue (hereafter, MB-PDT) at the time of percutaneous abscess drainage. Materials and Methods This prospective, open-label, dose-escalation, first-in-humans, registered phase 1 clinical study of MB-PDT included participants who underwent percutaneous abdominal or pelvic abscess drainage with CT or US guidance from January 2015 to March 2020 and September 2022 to September 2023. Following drainage, MB-PDT was performed with laser illumination at a fluence rate of 20 mW/cm2, with fluence groups of 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 J/cm2 (n = 3 each). The primary outcome was safety, indicated by absence of fat embolism, MB escape, abscess wall damage, and need for surgery to remove optical fibers. Preliminary efficacy end points included the time to drainage catheter removal, drainage catheter output volume, and clinical symptom and fever duration. Relationships between fluence and outcomes were analyzed with Spearman correlation and linear regression analyses, and ordinary one-way analysis of variance was used for group comparisons. Results MB-PDT was safe and feasible in all 18 participants (mean age, 60.1 years ± 18.3 [SD]; 10 female), with no negative safety outcomes observed for any participant. No study-related adverse events were encountered, and the procedure did not increase reported pain (P = .1). Clinical symptom and fever duration was shorter in participants receiving higher fluences (30 and 36 J/cm2 vs 6 J/cm2) (P = .03). The presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was not predictive of clinical symptom and fever duration (β = 0.13, P = .37). Conclusion MB-PDT was a safe and feasible adjunct to image-guided percutaneous abscess drainage. Clinical measures indicated a dose-dependent response to PDT.

    "abstract": "Background Right atrial (RA) function strain is increasingly acknowledged as an important predictor of adverse events in patients with diverse cardiovascular conditions. However, the prognostic value of RA strain in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains uncertain. Purpose To evaluate the prognostic value of RA strain derived from cardiac MRI (CMR) feature tracking (FT) in patients with DCM. Materials and Methods This multicenter, retrospective study included consecutive adult patients with DCM who underwent CMR between June 2010 and May 2022. RA strain parameters were obtained using CMR FT. The primary end points were sudden or cardiac death or heart transplant. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the association of variables with outcomes. Incremental prognostic value was evaluated using C indexes and likelihood ratio tests. Results A total of 526 patients with DCM (mean age, 51 years ± 15 [SD]; 381 male) were included. During a median follow-up of 41 months, 79 patients with DCM reached the primary end points. At univariable analysis, RA conduit strain was associated with the primary end points (hazard ratio [HR], 0.82 [95% CI: 0.76, 0.87]; P < .001). In multivariable Cox analysis, RA conduit strain was an independent predictor for the primary end points (HR, 0.83 [95% CI: 0.77, 0.90]; P < .001). A model combining RA conduit strain with other clinical and conventional imaging risk factors (C statistic, 0.80; likelihood ratio, 92.54) showed improved discrimination and calibration for the primary end points compared with models with clinical variables (C statistic, 0.71; likelihood ratio, 37.12; both P < .001) or clinical and imaging variables (C statistic, 0.75; likelihood ratio, 64.69; both P < .001). Conclusion CMR FT-derived RA conduit strain was an independent predictor of adverse outcomes among patients with DCM, providing incremental prognostic value when combined in a model with clinical and conventional CMR risk factors.

    "title": "Collaborative Enhancement of Consistency and Accuracy in US Diagnosis of Thyroid Nodules Using Large Language Models.",
    "abstract": "Background Large language models (LLMs) hold substantial promise for medical imaging interpretation. However, there is a lack of studies on their feasibility in handling reasoning questions associated with medical diagnosis. Purpose To investigate the viability of leveraging three publicly available LLMs to enhance consistency and diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging based on standardized reporting, with pathology as the reference standard. Materials and Methods US images of thyroid nodules with pathologic results were retrospectively collected from a tertiary referral hospital between July 2022 and December 2022 and used to evaluate malignancy diagnoses generated by three LLMs-OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5, ChatGPT 4.0, and Google's Bard. Inter- and intra-LLM agreement of diagnosis were evaluated. Then, diagnostic performance, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), was evaluated and compared for the LLMs and three interactive approaches: human reader combined with LLMs, image-to-text model combined with LLMs, and an end-to-end convolutional neural network model. Results A total of 1161 US images of thyroid nodules (498 benign, 663 malignant) from 725 patients (mean age, 42.2 years ± 14.1 [SD]; 516 women) were evaluated. ChatGPT 4.0 and Bard displayed substantial to almost perfect intra-LLM agreement (κ range, 0.65-0.86 [95% CI: 0.64, 0.86]), while ChatGPT 3.5 showed fair to substantial agreement (κ range, 0.36-0.68 [95% CI: 0.36, 0.68]). ChatGPT 4.0 had an accuracy of 78%-86% (95% CI: 76%, 88%) and sensitivity of 86%-95% (95% CI: 83%, 96%), compared with 74%-86% (95% CI: 71%, 88%) and 74%-91% (95% CI: 71%, 93%), respectively, for Bard. Moreover, with ChatGPT 4.0, the image-to-text-LLM strategy exhibited an AUC (0.83 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.85]) and accuracy (84% [95% CI: 82%, 86%]) comparable to those of the human-LLM interaction strategy with two senior readers and one junior reader and exceeding those of the human-LLM interaction strategy with one junior reader. Conclusion LLMs, particularly integrated with image-to-text approaches, show potential in enhancing diagnostic medical imaging. ChatGPT 4.0 was optimal for consistency and diagnostic accuracy when compared with Bard and ChatGPT 3.5. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "title": "Interpretation, Reporting, and Clinical Applications of Liver MR Elastography.",
    "abstract": "Chronic liver disease is highly prevalent and often leads to fibrosis or cirrhosis and complications such as liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. The diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis is crucial to determine management and mitigate complications. Liver biopsy for histologic assessment has limitations such as sampling bias and high interreader variability that reduce precision, which is particularly challenging in longitudinal monitoring. MR elastography (MRE) is considered the most accurate noninvasive technique for diagnosing and staging liver fibrosis. In MRE, low-frequency vibrations are applied to the abdomen, and the propagation of shear waves through the liver is analyzed to measure liver stiffness, a biomarker for the detection and staging of liver fibrosis. As MRE has become more widely used in clinical care and research, different contexts of use have emerged. This review focuses on the latest developments in the use of MRE for the assessment of liver fibrosis; provides guidance for image acquisition and interpretation; summarizes diagnostic performance, along with thresholds for diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis; discusses current and emerging clinical applications; and describes the latest technical developments.",

    "title": "Assessing Authorship Rates over Time in Original Radiologic Research Publications.",
    "abstract": "Background Previous studies have shown an increase in the number of authors on radiologic articles between 1950 and 2013, but the cause is unclear. Purpose To determine whether authorship rate in radiologic and general medical literature has continued to increase and to assess study variables associated with increased author numbers. Materials and Methods PubMed/Medline was searched for articles published between January 1998 and October 2022 in general radiology and general medical journals with the top five highest current impact factors. Generalized linear regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the numbers of authors. Wald tests assessed the associations between study variables and the numbers of authors per article. Combined mixed-effects regression analysis was performed to compare general medicine and radiology journals. Results There were 3381 original radiologic research articles that were analyzed. Authorship rate increased between 1998 (median, six authors; IQR, 4) and 2022 (median, 11 authors; IQR, 8). Later publication year was associated with more authors per article (IRR, 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.02; P < .001) after adjusting for publishing journal, continent of origin of first author, number of countries involved, PubMed/Medline original article type, study design, number of disciplines involved, multicenter or single-center study, reporting of a priori power calculation, reporting of obtaining informed consent, study sample size, and number of article pages. There were 1250 general medicine original research articles that were analyzed. Later publication year was also associated with more authors after adjustment for the study variables (IRR, 1.04; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.05; P < .001). There was a stronger increase in authorship by publication year for general medicine journals compared with radiology journals (IRR, 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.02; P < .001). Conclusion An increase in authorship rate was observed in the radiologic and general medical literature between 1998 and 2022, and the number of authors per article was independently associated with later year of publication. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Prostatic artery embolization (PAE) is a safe, minimally invasive angiographic procedure that effectively treats benign prostatic hyperplasia; however, PAE-related patient radiation exposure and associated risks are not completely understood. Purpose To quantify radiation dose and assess radiation-related adverse events in patients who underwent PAE at multiple centers. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients undergoing PAE for any indication performed by experienced operators at 10 high-volume international centers from January 2014 to May 2021. Patient characteristics, procedural and radiation dose data, and radiation-related adverse events were collected. Procedural radiation effective doses were calculated by multiplying kerma-area product values by an established conversion factor for abdominopelvic fluoroscopy-guided procedures. Relationships between cumulative air kerma (CAK) or effective dose and patient body mass index (BMI), fluoroscopy time, or radiation field area were assessed with linear regression. Differences in radiation dose stemming from radiopaque prostheses or fluoroscopy unit type were assessed using two-sample t tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results A total of 1476 patients (mean age, 69.9 years ± 9.0 [SD]) were included, of whom 1345 (91.1%) and 131 (8.9%) underwent the procedure with fixed interventional or mobile fluoroscopy units, respectively. Median procedure effective dose was 17.8 mSv for fixed interventional units and 12.3 mSv for mobile units. CAK and effective dose both correlated positively with BMI (R2 = 0.15 and 0.17; P < .001) and fluoroscopy time (R2 = 0.16 and 0.08; P < .001). No radiation-related 90-day adverse events were reported. Patients with radiopaque implants versus those without implants had higher median CAK (1452 mGy [range, 900-2685 mGy] vs 1177 mGy [range, 700-1959 mGy], respectively; P = .01). Median effective dose was lower for mobile than for fixed interventional systems (12.3 mSv [range, 8.5-22.0 mSv] vs 20.4 mSv [range, 13.8-30.6 mSv], respectively; P < .001). Conclusion Patients who underwent PAE performed with fixed interventional or mobile fluoroscopy units were exposed to a median effective radiation dose of 17.8 mSv or 12.3 mSv, respectively. No radiation-related adverse events at 90 days were reported. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Mahesh in this issue.",

    "abstract": "Background Coronary artery calcium (CAC) has prognostic value for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in asymptomatic individuals, whereas its role in symptomatic patients is less clear. Purpose To assess the prognostic value of CAC scoring for MACE in participants with stable chest pain initially referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Materials and Methods This prespecified subgroup analysis from the Diagnostic Imaging Strategies for Patients With Stable Chest Pain and Intermediate Risk of Coronary Artery Disease (DISCHARGE) trial, conducted between October 2015 and April 2019 across 26 centers in 16 countries, focused on adult patients with stable chest pain referred for ICA. Participants were randomly assigned to undergo either ICA or coronary CT. CAC scores from noncontrast CT scans were categorized into low, intermediate, and high groups based on scores of 0, 1-399, and 400 or higher, respectively. The end point of the study was the occurrence of MACE (myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death) over a median 3.5-year follow-up, analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression tests. Results The study involved 1749 participants (mean age, 60 years ± 10 [SD]; 992 female). The prevalence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) at CT angiography rose from 4.1% (95% CI: 2.8, 5.8) in the CAC score 0 group to 76.1% (95% CI: 70.3, 81.2) in the CAC score 400 or higher group. Revascularization rates increased from 1.7% to 46.2% across the same groups (P < .001). The CAC score 0 group had a lower MACE risk (0.5%; HR, 0.08 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.30]; P < .001), as did the 1-399 CAC score group (1.9%; HR, 0.27 [95% CI: 0.13, 0.59]; P = .001), compared with the 400 or higher CAC score group (6.8%). No significant difference in MACE between sexes was observed (P = .68). Conclusion In participants with stable chest pain initially referred for ICA, a CAC score of 0 showed very low risk of MACE, and higher CAC scores showed increasing risk of obstructive CAD, revascularization, and MACE at follow-up.

    "title": "MRI-guided Focused Ultrasound Focal Therapy for Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: Final Results from a 2-year Phase II Clinical Trial.",
    "abstract": "Background MRI-guided focal therapy (FT) allows for accurate targeting of localized clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) while preserving healthy prostate tissue, but the long-term outcomes of this approach require more study. Purpose To assess the 2-year oncological and functional outcomes of men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa) treated with targeted FT. Materials and Methods In this single-center prospective phase II trial, men with localized unifocal intermediate-risk PCa underwent transrectal MRI-guided focused ultrasound between July 2016 and July 2019. Planned ablation volumes included 10-mm margins when possible. Data regarding adverse events were collected and quality-of-life questionnaires were completed by participants at 6 weeks and at 5, 12, 18, and 24 months after treatment. Multiparametric MRI and targeted and systematic biopsies were performed at 24 months. Ablation volumes were determined by manual contouring of nonperfused volumes on immediate contrast-enhanced images. Generalized estimating equations were used to model trends in quality-of-life measures. Results Treatment was successfully completed in the 44 participants (median age, 67 years; IQR, 62-70 years; 36 patients with grade group [GG] 2; eight patients with GG 3). No major adverse events from treatment were recorded. One participant refused biopsy at 24 months. After 2 years, 39 of 43 participants (91%) had no csPCa at the treatment site and 36 of 43 (84%) had no cancer in the entire gland. No changes in International Index of Erectile Function-15 score or International Prostate Symptom Score were observed during 2-year follow-up (P = .73 and .39, respectively). Conclusion The majority of men treated with MRI-guided focused ultrasound for intermediate risk PCa had negative results for csPCa at biopsy 2 years after treatment. Additionally, there was no significant decline in quality of life per the validated questionnaires. Clinical trial registration no.

    "title": "The Role of Imaging for GI Bleeding: ACG and SAR Consensus Recommendations.",
    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is the most common GI diagnosis leading to hospitalization within the United States. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of GI bleeding is critical to improving patient outcomes and reducing high health care utilization and costs. Radiologic techniques including CT angiography, catheter angiography, CT enterography, MR enterography, nuclear medicine red blood cell scan, and technetium-99m pertechnetate scintigraphy (Meckel scan) are frequently used to evaluate patients with GI bleeding and are complementary to GI endoscopy. However, multiple management guidelines exist, which differ in the recommended utilization of these radiologic examinations. This variability can lead to confusion as to how these tests should be used in the evaluation of GI bleeding. In this document, a panel of experts from the American College of Gastroenterology and Society of Abdominal Radiology provide a review of the radiologic examinations used to evaluate for GI bleeding including nomenclature, technique, performance, advantages, and limitations. A comparison of advantages and limitations relative to endoscopic examinations is also included. Finally, consensus statements and recommendations on technical parameters and utilization of radiologic techniques for GI bleeding are provided. © Radiological Society of North America and the American College of Gastroenterology, 2024.

    "abstract": "Background Translocator protein (TSPO) PET has been used to visualize microglial activation in neuroinflammation and is a potential imaging tool for detecting autoimmune encephalitis (AIE). Purpose To compare the detection rate between TSPO radioligand fluorine 18 (18F) DPA-714 PET and conventional MRI and assess the relationship between 18F-DPA-714 uptake and clinical features in participants with AIE. Materials and Methods Healthy volunteers and patients with AIE were enrolled in this prospective study between December 2021 and April 2023. All participants underwent hybrid brain 18F-DPA-714 PET/MRI and antibody testing. Modified Rankin scale scoring and AIE-related symptoms were assessed in participants with AIE. Positive findings were defined as intensity of 18F-DPA-714 uptake above a threshold of the mean standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) plus 2 SD inside the corresponding brain regions of healthy controls. The McNemar test was used to compare the positive detection rate between the two imaging modalities; the independent samples t test was used to compare continuous variables; and correlation with Bonferroni correction was used to assess the relationship between 18F-DPA-714 uptake and clinical features. Results A total of 25 participants with AIE (mean age, 39.24 years ± 19.03 [SD]) and 10 healthy controls (mean age, 28.70 years ± 5.14) were included. The positive detection rate of AIE was 72% (18 of 25) using 18F-DPA-714 PET compared to 44% (11 of 25) using conventional MRI, but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .065). Participants experiencing seizures exhibited significantly higher mean SUVR in the entire cortical region than those without seizures (1.23 ± 0.21 vs 1.15 ± 0.18; P = .003). Of the 13 participants with AIE who underwent follow-up PET/MRI, 11 (85%) demonstrated reduced uptake of 18F-DPA-714 accompanied by relief of symptoms after immunosuppressive treatment. Conclusion 18F-DPA-714 PET has potential value in supplementing MRI for AIE detection. Clinical trial registration no. NCT05293405 © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Environmental Sustainability and AI in Radiology: A Double-Edged Sword.",
    "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization, climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity. The global health care system, including medical imaging, must manage the health effects of climate change while at the same time addressing the large amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated in the delivery of care. Data centers and computational efforts are increasingly large contributors to GHG emissions in radiology. This is due to the explosive increase in big data and artificial intelligence (AI) applications that have resulted in large energy requirements for developing and deploying AI models. However, AI also has the potential to improve environmental sustainability in medical imaging. For example, use of AI can shorten MRI scan times with accelerated acquisition times, improve the scheduling efficiency of scanners, and optimize the use of decision-support tools to reduce low-value imaging. The purpose of this Radiology in Focus article is to discuss this duality at the intersection of environmental sustainability and AI in radiology. Further discussed are strategies and opportunities to decrease AI-related emissions and to leverage AI to improve sustainability in radiology, with a focus on health equity. Co-benefits of these strategies are explored, including lower cost and improved patient outcomes. Finally, knowledge gaps and areas for future research are highlighted.",

    "abstract": "Background Both Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) and histopathologic features provide prognostic information in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but whether LI-RADS is independently associated with survival is uncertain. Purpose To assess the association of LI-RADS categories and features with survival outcomes in patients with solitary resected HCC. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included patients with solitary resected HCC from three institutions examined with preoperative contrast-enhanced CT and/or MRI between January 2008 and December 2019. Three independent readers evaluated the LI-RADS version 2018 categories and features. Histopathologic features including World Health Organization tumor grade, microvascular and macrovascular invasion, satellite nodules, and tumor capsule were recorded. Overall survival and disease-free survival were assessed with Cox regression models. Marginal effects of nontargetoid features on survival were estimated using propensity score matching. Results A total of 360 patients (median age, 64 years [IQR, 56-70 years]; 280 male patients) were included. At CT and MRI, the LI-RADS LR-M category was associated with increased risk of recurrence (CT: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.83 [95% CI: 1.26, 2.66], P = .001; MRI: HR = 2.22 [95% CI: 1.56, 3.16], P < .001) and death (CT: HR = 2.47 [95% CI: 1.72, 3.55], P < .001; MRI: HR = 1.80 [95% CI: 1.32, 2.46], P < .001) independently of histopathologic features. The presence of at least one nontargetoid feature was associated with an increased risk of recurrence (CT: HR = 1.80 [95% CI: 1.36, 2.38], P < .001; MRI: HR = 1.93 [95% CI: 1.81, 2.06], P < .001) and death (CT: HR = 1.51 [95% CI: 1.10, 2.07], P < .010) independently of histopathologic features. In matched samples, recurrence was associated with the presence of at least one nontargetoid feature at CT (HR = 2.06 [95% CI: 1.15, 3.66]; P = .02) or MRI (HR = 1.79 [95% CI: 1.01, 3.20]; P = .048). Conclusion In patients with solitary resected HCC, LR-M category and nontargetoid features were negatively associated with survival independently of histopathologic characteristics. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are a promising cancer therapy; however, reliable and repeatable methods for tracking and monitoring CAR T cells in vivo remain underexplored. Purpose To investigate direct and indirect imaging strategies for tracking the biodistribution of CAR T cells and monitoring their therapeutic effect in target tumors. Materials and Methods CAR T cells co-expressing a tumor-targeting gene (anti-CD19 CAR) and a human somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (hSSTr2) reporter gene were generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. After direct labeling with zirconium 89 (89Zr)-p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine (DFO), CAR T cells were intravenously injected into immunodeficient mice with a CD19-positive and CD19-negative human tumor xenograft on the left and right flank, respectively. PET/MRI was used for direct in vivo imaging of 89Zr-DFO-labeled CAR T cells on days 0, 1, 3, and 7 and for indirect cell imaging with the radiolabeled somatostatin receptor-targeted ligand gallium 68 (68Ga)-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotide (DOTATOC) on days 6, 9, and 13. On day 13, mice were euthanized, and tissues and tumors were excised. Results The 89Zr-DFO-labeled CAR T cells were observed on PET/MRI scans in the liver and lungs of mice (n = 4) at all time points assessed. However, they were not visualized in CD19-positive or CD19-negative tumors, even on day 7. Serial 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/MRI showed CAR T cell accumulation in CD19-positive tumors but not in CD19-negative tumors from days 6 to 13. Notably, 68Ga-DOTATOC accumulation in CD19-positive tumors was highest on day 9 (mean percentage injected dose [%ID], 3.7% ± 1.0 [SD]) and decreased on day 13 (mean %ID, 2.6% ± 0.7) in parallel with a decrease in tumor volume (day 9: mean, 195 mm3 ± 27; day 13: mean, 127 mm3 ± 43) in the group with tumor growth inhibition. Enhanced immunohistochemistry staining of cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) and hSSTr2 was also observed in excised CD19-positive tumor tissues. Conclusion Direct and indirect cell imaging with PET/MRI enabled in vivo tracking and monitoring of CAR T cells in an animal model. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Laboratory investigation revealed the following normal values: hemoglobin level of 15.6 g/dL (normal range, 13-16 g/dL), platelet count of 240 × 103/µL (normal range, 140-440 × 103/µL), and total leukocyte count of 7100 cells/µL (normal range, 4500-11 000 cells/µL). The percentage of neutrophils was considered low at 44% (normal range, 54%-62%), and the percentage of eosinophils was slightly high at 3.7% (normal range, 0%-3%). An anteroposterior radiograph of the left hip is shown (Fig 1). Physical therapy was initiated, with no improvement after 2 weeks of therapy. The patient was referred to an orthopedist for further evaluation. On physical examination, the patient endorsed marked left hip pain with hip flexion to 90°, limited internal and external rotation (5° and 15°, respectively), and antalgic gait favoring the left leg. Hip MRI (Fig 2) and further serologic analysis were requested for further evaluation. Although the serologic testing was performed at an outside laboratory, the physician reported positive immunoglobulin-G Lyme titers, normal C-reactive protein level, and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Pelvic CT was requested (Fig 3). The patient was prescribed a course of doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 28 days), with reported resolution of symptoms 2 weeks after initiation of treatment. Three weeks later, he presented to our department with recurrent left hip pain, which was similar in severity compared with initial presentation. A second MRI of the left hip was performed 4 months after initial presentation (Fig 4).",

    "abstract": "Members of the Fleischner Society have compiled a glossary of terms for thoracic imaging that replaces previous glossaries published in 1984, 1996, and 2008, respectively. The impetus to update the previous version arose from multiple considerations. These include an awareness that new terms and concepts have emerged, others have become obsolete, and the usage of some terms has either changed or become inconsistent to a degree that warranted a new definition. This latest glossary is focused on terms of clinical importance and on those whose meaning may be perceived as vague or ambiguous. As with previous versions, the aim of the present glossary is to establish standardization of terminology for thoracic radiology and, thereby, to facilitate communications between radiologists and clinicians. Moreover, the present glossary aims to contribute to a more stringent use of terminology, increasingly required for structured reporting and accurate searches in large databases. Compared with the previous version, the number of images (chest radiography and CT) in the current version has substantially increased. The authors hope that this will enhance its educational and practical value. All definitions and images are hyperlinked throughout the text.

    "abstract": "An 81-year-old man living in South Korea was referred to the pulmonology clinic because of abnormal findings at routine surveillance CT. His past medical history included right radical nephroureterectomy for ureteral cancer in 2016, transurethral resection of a bladder tumor in 2015, and tuberculous pleurisy in his third decade of life that was complicated by a chronic calcified empyema. He had been doing well clinically until 6 months prior, when he presented to an outside hospital with progressive right-sided chest pain and dyspnea and was found to have active tuberculosis. During that hospitalization, he underwent chest CT and CT-guided biopsy of an incidentally found thoracic lesion, which revealed chronic active inflammation. His symptoms improved after initiation of antituberculous medication, and he was discharged home to complete treatment. Because of interval growth of this lesion noted on a subsequent surveillance CT scan, he was referred to pulmonology for further evaluation. Laboratory tests obtained during his visit revealed mild leukocytosis (1258 cells × 109/L; normal range, 4000-10 000 cells × 109/L) with neutrophilic predominance (82% neutrophils; normal range, 50%-75% neutrophils), and a mildly elevated C-reactive protein level (3.17 mg/dL; normal range, 0-0.5 mg/dL). A sputum culture was negative for tuberculosis. The patient reported mild chest discomfort and dyspnea. Liver MRI was performed to further evaluate an abnormal lesion seen at CT. Given the patient's recent nonspecific biopsy results and tuberculosis treatment, no further work-up was pursued. Contrast-enhanced chest CT was performed 6 months later because the patient developed worsening chest pain and dyspnea. He remained afebrile, with persistent leukocytosis (1485 cells × 109/L) and an elevated C-reactive protein level (3.56 mg/dL). On the basis of the imaging findings, repeat CT-guided biopsy and PET/CT were performed, thereby enabling confirmation of the diagnosis, and appropriate treatment was initiated.",

Photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT improves spatial resolution. Purpose To investigate the effect of improved spatial resolution on coronary stenosis assessment and reclassification. Materials and Methods Coronary stenoses were evaluated prospectively in a vessel phantom (in vitro) containing two stenoses (25%, 50%), and retrospectively in patients (in vivo) who underwent ultrahigh-spatial-resolution cardiac PCD CT (from July 2022 to April 2023). Images were reconstructed at standard resolution (section thickness, 0.6 mm; increment, 0.4 mm; Bv44 kernel), high spatial resolution (section thickness, 0.4 mm; increment, 0.2 mm; Bv44 kernel), and ultrahigh spatial resolution (section thickness, 0.2; increment, 0.1 mm; Bv64 kernel). Percentages of diameter stenosis (DS) were compared between reconstructions. In vitro values were compared with the manufacturer specifications of the phantom and patient results were assessed regarding effects on Coronary Artery Disease Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) reclassification. Results The in vivo sample included 114 patients (mean age, 68 years ± 9 [SD]; 71 male patients). In vitro percentage DS measurements were more accurate with increasing spatial resolution for both 25% and 50% stenoses (mean bias for standard resolution, high spatial resolution, and ultrahigh spatial resolution, respectively: 10.1%, 8.0%, and 2.3%; P < .001). In vivo results confirmed decreasing median percentage DS with increasing spatial resolution for calcified stenoses (n = 161) (standard resolution, high spatial resolution, and ultrahigh spatial resolution, respectively: 41.5% [IQR, 27.3%-58.2%], 34.8% [IQR, 23.7%-55.1%], and 26.7% [IQR, 18.6%-44.3%]; P < .001), whereas noncalcified (n = 13) and mixed plaques (n = 19) did not show evidence of a difference (P ≥ .88). Ultrahigh-spatial-resolution reconstructions led to reclassification of 62 of 114 (54.4%) patients to lower CAD-RADS category than that assigned using standard resolution. Conclusion In vivo and in vitro coronary stenosis assessment improved for calcified stenoses by using ultrahigh-spatial-resolution PCD CT reconstructions, leading to lower percentage DS compared with standard resolution and clinically relevant rates of reclassification. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Outcomes of Breast Cancer Screening Strategies Based on Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network Estimates.",
    "abstract": "Background There is ongoing debate about recommendations for breast cancer screening strategies, specifically regarding the frequency of screening and the age at which to initiate screening. Purpose To compare estimates of breast cancer screening outcomes published by the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) to understand the benefits and risks of different screening scenarios. Materials and Methods Modeling estimates published by CISNET are based on hypothetical cohorts in the United States and compare women, starting at 40 years of age, who do and do not undergo breast cancer screening with mammography. The four scenarios assessed in this study, of multiple possible scenarios, were biennial screening ages 50-74 years (2009 and 2016 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [USPSTF] recommendations), biennial screening ages 40-74 years (2023 USPSTF draft recommendation), annual screening ages 40-74 years, and annual screening ages 40-79 years. For each scenario, CISNET estimates of median lifetime benefits were compared. Risks that included false-positive screening results per examination and benign biopsies per examination were also calculated and compared. Results Estimates from CISNET 2023 showed that annual screening ages 40-79 years improved breast cancer mortality reduction compared with biennial screening ages 50-74 years and biennial screening ages 40-74 years (41.7%, 25.4%, and 30%, respectively). Annual screening ages 40-79 years averted the most breast cancer deaths (11.5 per 1000) and gained the most life-years (230 per 1000) compared with other screening scenarios (range, 6.7-11.5 per 1000 and 121-230 per 1000, respectively). False-positive screening results per examination were less than 10% for all screening scenarios (range, 6.5%-9.6%) and lowest for annual screening ages 40-79 years (6.5%). Benign biopsies per examination were less than 1.33% for all screening scenarios (range, 0.88%-1.32%) and lowest for annual screening ages 40-79 years (0.88%). Conclusion CISNET 2023 modeling estimates indicate that annual breast cancer screening starting at 40 years of age provides the greatest benefit to women and the least risk per examination. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Joe in this issue.",

    "title": "Social Determinants of Health Framework to Identify and Reduce Barriers to Imaging in Marginalized Communities.",
    "abstract": "Social determinants of health (SDOH) are conditions influencing individuals' health based on their environment of birth, living, working, and aging. Addressing SDOH is crucial for promoting health equity and reducing health outcome disparities. For conditions such as stroke and cancer screening where imaging is central to diagnosis and management, access to high-quality medical imaging is necessary. This article applies a previously described structural framework characterizing the impact of SDOH on patients who require imaging for their clinical indications. SDOH factors can be broadly categorized into five sectors: economic stability, education access and quality, neighborhood and built environment, social and community context, and health care access and quality. As patients navigate the health care system, they experience barriers at each step, which are significantly influenced by SDOH factors. Marginalized communities are prone to disparities due to the inability to complete the required diagnostic or screening imaging work-up. This article highlights SDOH that disproportionately affect marginalized communities, using stroke and cancer as examples of disease processes where imaging is needed for care. Potential strategies to mitigate these disparities include dedicating resources for clinical care coordinators, transportation, language assistance, and financial hardship subsidies. Last, various national and international health initiatives are tackling SDOH and fostering health equity.",

    "title": "Ultrafast Brain MRI with Deep Learning Reconstruction for Suspected Acute Ischemic Stroke.",
    "abstract": "Background Deep learning (DL)-accelerated MRI can substantially reduce examination times. However, studies prospectively evaluating the diagnostic performance of DL-accelerated MRI reconstructions in acute suspected stroke are lacking. Purpose To investigate the interchangeability of DL-accelerated MRI with conventional MRI in patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke at 1.5 T. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, 211 participants with suspected acute stroke underwent clinically indicated MRI at 1.5 T between June 2022 and March 2023. For each participant, conventional MRI (including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, T2*-weighted, T2 fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery, and diffusion-weighted imaging; 14 minutes 18 seconds) and DL-accelerated MRI (same sequences; 3 minutes 4 seconds) were performed. The primary end point was the interchangeability between conventional and DL-accelerated MRI for acute ischemic infarction detection. Secondary end points were interchangeability regarding the affected vascular territory and clinically relevant secondary findings (eg, microbleeds, neoplasm). Three readers evaluated the overall occurrence of acute ischemic stroke, affected vascular territory, clinically relevant secondary findings, overall image quality, and diagnostic confidence. For acute ischemic lesions, size and signal intensities were assessed. The margin for interchangeability was chosen as 5%. For interrater agreement analysis and interrater reliability analysis, multirater Fleiss κ and the intraclass correlation coefficient, respectively, was determined. Results The study sample consisted of 211 participants (mean age, 65 years ± 16 [SD]); 123 male and 88 female). Acute ischemic stroke was confirmed in 79 participants. Interchangeability was demonstrated for all primary and secondary end points. No individual equivalence indexes (IEIs) exceeded the interchangeability margin of 5% (IEI, -0.002 [90% CI: -0.007, 0.004]). Almost perfect interrater agreement was observed (P > .91). DL-accelerated MRI provided higher overall image quality (P < .001) and diagnostic confidence (P < .001). The signal properties of acute ischemic infarctions were similar in both techniques and demonstrated good to excellent interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, ≥0.8). Conclusion Despite being four times faster, DL-accelerated brain MRI was interchangeable with conventional MRI for acute ischemic lesion detection. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background The independent contribution of each Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) CT or MRI ancillary feature (AF) has not been established. Purpose To evaluate the association of LI-RADS AFs with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and malignancy while adjusting for LI-RADS major features through an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. Materials and Methods Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Scopus were searched from January 2014 to January 2022 for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of CT and MRI for HCC using LI-RADS version 2014, 2017, or 2018. Using a one-step approach, IPD across studies were pooled. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were derived from multivariable logistic regression models of each AF combined with major features except threshold growth (excluded because of infrequent reporting). Liver observation clustering was addressed at the study and participant levels through random intercepts. Risk of bias was assessed using a composite reference standard and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2. Results Twenty studies comprising 3091 observations (2456 adult participants; mean age, 59 years ± 11 [SD]; 1849 [75.3%] men) were included. In total, 89% (eight of nine) of AFs favoring malignancy were associated with malignancy and/or HCC, 80% (four of five) of AFs favoring HCC were associated with HCC, and 57% (four of seven) of AFs favoring benignity were negatively associated with HCC and/or malignancy. Nonenhancing capsule (OR = 3.50 [95% CI: 1.53, 8.01]) had the strongest association with HCC. Diffusion restriction (OR = 14.45 [95% CI: 9.82, 21.27]) and mild-moderate T2 hyperintensity (OR = 10.18 [95% CI: 7.17, 14.44]) had the strongest association with malignancy. The strongest negative associations with HCC were parallels blood pool enhancement (OR = 0.07 [95% CI: 0.01, 0.49]) and marked T2 hyperintensity (OR = 0.18 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.45]). Seventeen studies (85%) had a high risk of bias. Conclusion Most LI-RADS AFs were independently associated with HCC, malignancy, or benignity as intended when adjusting for major features. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Recent trials support the role of cardiac CT in the evaluation of symptomatic patients suspected of having coronary artery disease (CAD); however, body mass index (BMI) has been reported to negatively impact CT image quality. Purpose To compare initial use of CT versus invasive coronary angiography (ICA) on clinical outcomes in patients with stable chest pain stratified by BMI category. Materials and Methods This prospective study represents a prespecified BMI subgroup analysis of the multicenter Diagnostic Imaging Strategies for Patients with Stable Chest Pain and Intermediate Risk of Coronary Artery Disease (DISCHARGE) trial conducted between October 2015 and April 2019. Adult patients with stable chest pain and a CAD pretest probability of 10%-60% were randomly assigned to undergo initial CT or ICA. The primary end point was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke. The secondary end point was an expanded MACE composite, including transient ischemic attack, and major procedure-related complications. Competing risk analyses were performed using the Fine and Gray subdistribution Cox proportional hazard model to assess the impact of the relationship between BMI and initial management with CT or ICA on the study outcomes, whereas noncardiovascular death and unknown causes of death were considered competing risk events. Results Among the 3457 participants included, 831 (24.0%), 1358 (39.3%), and 1268 (36.7%) had a BMI of less than 25, between 25 and 30, and greater than 30 kg/m2, respectively. No interaction was found between CT or ICA and BMI for MACE (P = .29), the expanded MACE composite (P = .38), or major procedure-related complications (P = .49). Across all BMI subgroups, expanded MACE composite events (CT, 10 of 409 [2.4%] to 23 of 697 [3.3%]; ICA, 26 of 661 [3.9%] to 21 of 422 [5.1%]) and major procedure-related complications during initial management (CT, one of 638 [0.2%] to five of 697 [0.7%]; ICA, nine of 630 [1.4%] to 12 of 422 [2.9%]) were less frequent in the CT versus ICA group. Participants with a BMI exceeding 30 kg/m² exhibited a higher nondiagnostic CT rate (7.1%, P = .044) compared to participants with lower BMI. Conclusion There was no evidence of a difference in outcomes between CT and ICA across the three BMI subgroups. Clinical trial registration no.

    "abstract": "Published in 2021, the fifth edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) introduced new molecular criteria for tumor types that commonly occur in either pediatric or adult age groups. Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) are at the intersection of adult and pediatric care, and both pediatric-type and adult-type CNS tumors occur at that age. Mortality rates for AYAs with CNS tumors have increased by 0.6% per year for males and 1% per year for females from 2007 to 2016. To best serve patients, it is crucial that both pediatric and adult radiologists who interpret neuroimages are familiar with the various pediatric- and adult-type brain tumors and their typical imaging morphologic characteristics. Gliomas account for approximately 80% of all malignant CNS tumors in the AYA age group, with the most common types observed being diffuse astrocytic and glioneuronal tumors. Ependymomas and medulloblastomas also occur in the AYA population but are seen less frequently. Importantly, biologic behavior and progression of distinct molecular subgroups of brain tumors differ across ages. This review discusses newly added or revised gliomas in the fifth edition of the CNS WHO classification, as well as other CNS tumor types common in the AYA population.",

    "abstract": "Background Image-guided tumor ablation is the first-line therapy for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with ongoing investigations into its combination with immunotherapies. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibition demonstrates immunomodulatory potential and reduces HCC tumor growth when combined with ablative treatment. Purpose To evaluate the effect of incomplete cryoablation with or without MMP inhibition on the local immune response in residual tumors in a murine HCC model. Materials and Methods Sixty 8- to 10-week-old female BALB/c mice underwent HCC induction with use of orthotopic implantation of syngeneic Tib-75 cells. After 7 days, mice with a single lesion were randomized into treatment groups: (a) no treatment, (b) MMP inhibitor, (c) incomplete cryoablation, and (d) incomplete cryoablation and MMP inhibitor. Macrophage and T-cell subsets were assessed in tissue samples with use of immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence (cell averages calculated using five 1-μm2 fields of view [FOVs]). C-X-C motif chemokine receptor type 3 (CXCR3)- and interferon γ (IFNγ)-positive T cells were assessed using flow cytometry. Groups were compared using unpaired Student t tests, one-way analysis of variance with Tukey correction, and the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn correction. Results Mice treated with incomplete cryoablation (n = 6) showed greater infiltration of CD206+ tumor-associated macrophages (mean, 1.52 cells per FOV vs 0.64 cells per FOV; P = .03) and MMP9-expressing cells (mean, 0.89 cells per FOV vs 0.11 cells per FOV; P = .03) compared with untreated controls (n = 6). Incomplete cryoablation with MMP inhibition (n = 6) versus without (n = 6) led to greater CD8+ T-cell (mean, 15.8% vs 8.29%; P = .04), CXCR3+CD8+ T-cell (mean, 11.64% vs 8.47%; P = .004), and IFNγ+CD8+ T-cell infiltration (mean, 11.58% vs 5.18%; P = .02). Conclusion In a mouse model of HCC, incomplete cryoablation and systemic MMP inhibition showed increased cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the residual tumor compared with either treatment alone. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Materials and Methods In this prospective controlled trial, participants with chronic severe tinnitus were randomized from December 2017 to December 2021 to receive either CBT (CBT group) for 10 weekly group sessions or real-time fMRI neurofeedback (fMRI group) individually during 15 weekly sessions. Change in the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score (range, 0-100) from baseline to 6 or 12 months was assessed. Secondary outcomes included four quality-of-life questionnaires (Beck Depression Inventory, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule). Questionnaire scores between treatment groups and between time points were assessed using repeated measures analysis of variance and the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results The fMRI group included 21 participants (mean age, 49 years ± 11.4 [SD]; 16 male participants) and the CBT group included 22 participants (mean age, 53.6 years ± 8.8; 16 male participants). The fMRI group showed a greater reduction in THI scores compared with the CBT group at both 6 months (mean score change, -28.21 points ± 18.66 vs -12.09 points ± 18.86; P = .005) and 12 months (mean score change, -30 points ± 25.44 vs -4 points ± 17.2; P = .01). Compared with baseline, the fMRI group showed improved sleep (mean score, 8.62 points ± 4.59 vs 7.25 points ± 3.61; P = .006) and trait anxiety (mean score, 44 points ± 11.5 vs 39.84 points ± 10.5; P = .02) at 1 month and improved depression (mean score, 13.71 points ± 9.27 vs 6.53 points ± 5.17; P = .01) and general functioning (mean score, 24.91 points ± 17.05 vs 13.06 points ± 10.1; P = .01) at 6 months. No difference in these metrics over time was observed for the CBT group (P value range, .14 to >.99). Conclusion Real-time fMRI neurofeedback therapy led to a greater reduction in tinnitus distress than the current standard treatment of CBT.

    "abstract": "Background The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-American College of Radiology Imaging Network Cancer Research Group multicenter A6702 trial identified an optimal apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) cutoff to potentially reduce biopsies by 21% without affecting sensitivity. Whether this performance can be achieved in clinical settings has not yet been established. Purpose To validate the performance of point-of-care ADC measurements with the A6702 trial ADC cutoff for reducing unnecessary biopsies in lesions detected at breast MRI. Materials and Methods Consecutive breast MRI examinations performed from May 2015 to January 2019 at a single medical center and showing biopsy-confirmed Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 4 or 5 lesions, without ipsilateral cancer, were identified. Point-of-care lesion ADC measurements collected at clinical interpretation were retrospectively evaluated. MRI examinations included axial T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences. Sensitivity and biopsy reduction rates were calculated by applying the A6702 optimal (ADC, 1.53 × 10-3 mm2/sec) and alternate conservative (1.68 × 10-3 mm2/sec) cutoffs. Lesion pathologic outcomes were the reference standard. To assess reproducibility, one radiologist repeated ADC measurements, and agreement was summarized using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results A total of 240 lesions in 201 women (mean age, 49 years ± 13 [SD]) with pathologic outcomes (63 malignant and 177 benign) were included. Applying the optimal ADC cutoff produced an overall biopsy reduction rate of 15.8% (38 of 240 lesions [95% CI: 11.2, 20.9]), with a sensitivity of 92.1% (58 of 63 lesions [95% CI: 82.4, 97.4]; sensitivity was 97.2% [35 of 36 lesions] [95% CI: 82.7, 99.6] for invasive cancers). Results were similar for screening versus diagnostic examinations (P = .92 and .40, respectively). Sensitivity was higher for masses than for nonmass enhancements (NMEs) (100% vs 85.3%; P = .009). Applying the conservative ADC cutoff achieved a sensitivity of 95.2% (60 of 63 lesions [95% CI: 86.7, 99.0]), with a biopsy reduction rate of 10.4% (25 of 240 lesions [95% CI: 6.7, 14.5]). Repeated single-reader measurements showed good agreement with clinical ADCs (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.72 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.81]). Conclusion This study validated the clinical use of ADC cutoffs to reduce MRI-prompted biopsies by up to 16%, with a suggested tradeoff of lowered sensitivity for in situ and microinvasive disease manifesting as NME.

    "abstract": "Background There is clinical need to better quantify lung disease severity in pulmonary hypertension (PH), particularly in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and PH associated with lung disease (PH-LD). Purpose To quantify fibrosis on CT pulmonary angiograms using an artificial intelligence (AI) model and to assess whether this approach can be used in combination with radiologic scoring to predict survival. Materials and Methods This retrospective multicenter study included adult patients with IPAH or PH-LD who underwent incidental CT imaging between February 2007 and January 2019. Patients were divided into training and test cohorts based on the institution of imaging. The test cohort included imaging examinations performed in 37 external hospitals. Fibrosis was quantified using an established AI model and radiologically scored by radiologists. Multivariable Cox regression adjusted for age, sex, World Health Organization functional class, pulmonary vascular resistance, and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide was performed. The performance of predictive models with or without AI-quantified fibrosis was assessed using the concordance index (C index). Results The training and test cohorts included 275 (median age, 68 years [IQR, 60-75 years]; 128 women) and 246 (median age, 65 years [IQR, 51-72 years]; 142 women) patients, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that AI-quantified percentage of fibrosis was associated with an increased risk of patient mortality in the training cohort (hazard ratio, 1.01 [95% CI: 1.00, 1.02]; P = .04). This finding was validated in the external test cohort (C index, 0.76). The model combining AI-quantified fibrosis and radiologic scoring showed improved performance for predicting patient mortality compared with a model including radiologic scoring alone (C index, 0.67 vs 0.61; P < .001). Conclusion Percentage of lung fibrosis quantified on CT pulmonary angiograms by an AI model was associated with increased risk of mortality and showed improved performance for predicting patient survival when used in combination with radiologic severity scoring compared with radiologic scoring alone. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Filters are commonly used to enhance specific structures and patterns in images, such as vessels or peritumoral regions, to enable clinical insights beyond the visible image using radiomics. However, their lack of standardization restricts reproducibility and clinical translation of radiomics decision support tools. In this special report, teams of researchers who developed radiomics software participated in a three-phase study (September 2020 to December 2022) to establish a standardized set of filters. The first two phases focused on finding reference filtered images and reference feature values for commonly used convolutional filters: mean, Laplacian of Gaussian, Laws and Gabor kernels, separable and nonseparable wavelets (including decomposed forms), and Riesz transformations. In the first phase, 15 teams used digital phantoms to establish 33 reference filtered images of 36 filter configurations. In phase 2, 11 teams used a chest CT image to derive reference values for 323 of 396 features computed from filtered images using 22 filter and image processing configurations. Reference filtered images and feature values for Riesz transformations were not established. Reproducibility of standardized convolutional filters was validated on a public data set of multimodal imaging (CT, fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and T1-weighted MRI) in 51 patients with soft-tissue sarcoma. At validation, reproducibility of 486 features computed from filtered images using nine configurations × three imaging modalities was assessed using the lower bounds of 95% CIs of intraclass correlation coefficients. Out of 486 features, 458 were found to be reproducible across nine teams with lower bounds of 95% CIs of intraclass correlation coefficients greater than 0.75. In conclusion, eight filter types were standardized with reference filtered images and reference feature values for verifying and calibrating radiomics software packages.

Purpose To compare patient outcomes of HDR brachytherapy and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in patients with unresectable HCC. Materials and Methods This multi-institutional retrospective study included consecutive treatment-naive adult patients with unresectable HCC who underwent either HDR brachytherapy or TACE between January 2010 and December 2022. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared between patients matched for clinical and tumor characteristics by propensity score matching. Not all patients who underwent TACE had PFS available; thus, a different set of patients was used for PFS and OS analysis for this treatment. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated from Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Results After propensity matching, 150 patients who underwent HDR brachytherapy (median age, 71 years [IQR, 63-77 years]; 117 males) and 150 patients who underwent TACE (OS analysis median age, 70 years [IQR, 63-77 years]; 119 male; PFS analysis median age, 68 years [IQR: 63-76 years]; 119 male) were analyzed. Hazard of death was higher in the TACE versus HDR brachytherapy group (HR, 4.04; P < .001). Median estimated PFS was 32.8 months (95% CI: 12.5, 58.7) in the HDR brachytherapy group and 11.6 months (95% CI: 4.9, 22.7) in the TACE group. Hazard of disease progression was higher in the TACE versus HDR brachytherapy group (HR, 2.23; P < .001). Conclusion In selected treatment-naive patients with unresectable HCC, treatment with CT-guided HDR brachytherapy led to improved OS and PFS compared with TACE. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Increased Attenuation of Intestinal Contents at CT Indicates Bowel Necrosis in Closed-Loop Small Bowel Obstruction.",
    "abstract": "Background Preoperative recognition of irreversible bowel necrosis is important, as it provides valuable guidance for surgical strategy selection but also may inform perioperative risk assessment and communication. Few studies have focused on the association between CT signs and bowel necrosis. Purpose To assess the diagnostic accuracy of CT signs to predict bowel necrosis in patients with closed-loop small bowel obstruction (CL-SBO). Materials and Methods This retrospective single-center study included patients who were surgically confirmed to have CL-SBO caused by adhesion or internal hernia between January 2016 and May 2022. Necrosis was determined based on surgical exploration and postoperative pathologic examination. Two radiologists independently reviewed CT signs by both subjective visual assessment and objective measurement. Disagreements were resolved in consensus with a third gastrointestinal radiologist. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to assess the association between CT signs and bowel necrosis, and Cohen κ was used to assess interobserver agreement. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each CT sign. Results This study included 145 patients: 61 (42.1%) in the necrotic group (median age, 62 years [IQR, 51-71.5 years]; 37 [60.7%] women) and 84 (57.9%) in the nonnecrotic group (median age, 61.5 years [IQR, 51-68.8 years]; 51 [60.7%] women). Univariable analysis and multivariable analysis showed that increased attenuation of intestinal contents and increased attenuation of intestinal wall were independent predictors for bowel necrosis (odds ratio = 45.3 and 15.1; P = .001 and P < .001, respectively). Increased attenuation of intestinal contents and increased attenuation of intestinal wall had similar sensitivity (64% and 67%, respectively) and specificity (99% and 92%, respectively) for predicting bowel necrosis. However, interobserver agreement was better for assessing the contents than the wall (κ = 0.84 and 0.59, respectively). Conclusion Increased attenuation of intestinal contents was a highly specific CT sign with good reproducibility to predict bowel necrosis in CL-SBO. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) form the cornerstone of current primary brain tumor MRI protocols at all stages of the patient journey. Though an imperfect measure of tumor grade, GBCAs are repeatedly used for diagnosis and monitoring. In practice, however, radiologists will encounter situations where GBCA injection is not needed or of doubtful benefit. Reducing GBCA administration could improve the patient burden of (repeated) imaging (especially in vulnerable patient groups, such as children), minimize risks of putative side effects, and benefit costs, logistics, and the environmental footprint. On the basis of the current literature, imaging strategies to reduce GBCA exposure for pediatric and adult patients with primary brain tumors will be reviewed. Early postoperative MRI and fixed-interval imaging of gliomas are examples of GBCA exposure with uncertain survival benefits. Half-dose GBCAs for gliomas and T2-weighted imaging alone for meningiomas are among options to reduce GBCA use. While most imaging guidelines recommend using GBCAs at all stages of diagnosis and treatment, non-contrast-enhanced sequences, such as the arterial spin labeling, have shown a great potential. Artificial intelligence methods to generate synthetic postcontrast images from decreased-dose or non-GBCA scans have shown promise to replace GBCA-dependent approaches. This review is focused on pediatric and adult gliomas and meningiomas. Special attention is paid to the quality and real-life applicability of the reviewed literature.",

The patient was taking prednisone and leflunomide to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Her headache was primarily left sided and occasionally radiated to the occipital region. The patient had a high-grade fever spike, with a temperature of 104°F (40°C). Results of a prior lumbar puncture and temporal artery biopsy from an outside hospital were negative. Findings of a neurologic examination were unremarkable. Oropharyngeal examination for dysphagia revealed minimal pharyngeal motility, with pooling of food in the pharynx, which was thought to be due to cranial nerve dysfunction. Laboratory analysis revealed that, except for anemia, complete blood count parameters were within normal limits. C-reactive protein level (49.7 mg/L; reference range, 0.0-8.0 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (>140 mm/h with Westergren method; reference range, 0-27 mm/h), and brain-type natriuretic peptide level (145 pg/mL; reference range, 0-100 pg/mL) were elevated. Blood and urine cultures were negative. A lumbar puncture was performed, which revealed cloudy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with an elevated CSF protein level (78 mg/dL; reference range, 7.0-35.0 mg/dL) and a low CSF glucose level (37 mg/dL [2.05 mmol/L]; reference range, 45-70 mg/dL [2.50-3.89 mmol/L]); otherwise, CSF encephalopathy, an autoimmune panel, and cultures were negative. MRI and CT scans of the brain with paranasal sinus were performed (Figs 1-3). Nasal endoscopy-guided drainage of the preclival fluid collection was performed, and biopsy of nasopharyngeal tissue was performed. Fluid culture revealed the growth of Candida albicans, as well as Pseudomonas and Enterobacter aerogenes. The patient received fluconazole, ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole. Follow-up MRI was performed after 2 weeks (Fig 4).",

    "abstract": "Background Patients have the highest risk of subsequent fractures in the first few years after an initial fracture, yet models to predict short-term subsequent risk have not been developed. Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning prediction model for subsequent fracture risk using digitally reconstructed radiographs from hip CT in patients with recent hip fractures. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included adult patients who underwent three-dimensional hip CT due to a fracture from January 2004 to December 2020. Two-dimensional frontal, lateral, and axial digitally reconstructed radiographs were generated and assembled to construct an ensemble model. DenseNet modules were used to calculate risk probability based on extracted image features and fracture-free probability plots were output. Model performance was assessed using the C index and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared with other models using the paired t test. Results The training and validation set included 1012 patients (mean age, 74.5 years ± 13.3 [SD]; 706 female, 113 subsequent fracture) and the test set included 468 patients (mean age, 75.9 years ± 14.0; 335 female, 22 subsequent fractures). In the test set, the ensemble model had a higher C index (0.73) for predicting subsequent fractures than that of other image-based models (C index range, 0.59-0.70 for five of six models; P value range, < .001 to < .05). The ensemble model achieved AUCs of 0.74, 0.74, and 0.73 at the 2-, 3-, and 5-year follow-ups, respectively; higher than that of most other image-based models at 2 years (AUC range, 0.57-0.71 for five of six models; P value range, < .001 to < .05) and 3 years (AUC range, 0.55-0.72 for four of six models; P value range, < .001 to < .05). Moreover, the AUCs achieved by the ensemble model were higher than that of a clinical model that included known risk factors (2-, 3-, and 5-year AUCs of 0.58, 0.64, and 0.70, respectively; P < .001 for all). Conclusion In patients with recent hip fractures, the ensemble deep learning model using digital reconstructed radiographs from hip CT showed good performance for predicting subsequent fractures in the short term. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background The natural history of colorectal polyps is not well characterized due to clinical standards of care and other practical constraints limiting in vivo longitudinal surveillance. Established CT colonography (CTC) clinical screening protocols allow surveillance of small (6-9 mm) polyps. Purpose To assess the natural history of colorectal polyps followed with CTC in a clinical screening program, with histopathologic correlation for resected polyps. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, CTC was used to longitudinally monitor small colorectal polyps in asymptomatic adult patients from April 1, 2004, to August 31, 2020. All patients underwent at least two CTC examinations. Polyp growth patterns across multiple time points were analyzed, with histopathologic context for resected polyps. Regression analysis was performed to evaluate predictors of advanced histopathology. Results In this study of 475 asymptomatic adult patients (mean age, 56.9 years ± 6.7 [SD]; 263 men), 639 unique polyps (mean initial diameter, 6.3 mm; volume, 50.2 mm3) were followed for a mean of 5.1 years ± 2.9. Of these 639 polyps, 398 (62.3%) underwent resection and histopathologic evaluation, and 41 (6.4%) proved to be histopathologically advanced (adenocarcinoma, high-grade dysplasia, or villous content), including two cancers and 38 tubulovillous adenomas. Advanced polyps showed mean volume growth of +178% per year (752% per year for adenocarcinomas) compared with +33% per year for nonadvanced polyps and -3% per year for unresected, unretrieved, or resolved polyps (P < .001). In addition, 90% of histologically advanced polyps achieved a volume of 100 mm3 and/or volume growth rate of 100% per year, compared with 29% of nonadvanced and 16% of unresected or resolved polyps (P < .001). Polyp volume-to-diameter ratio was also significantly greater for advanced polyps. For polyps observed at three or more time points, most advanced polyps demonstrated an initial slower growth interval, followed by a period of more rapid growth. Conclusion Small colorectal polyps ultimately proving to be histopathologically advanced neoplasms demonstrated substantially faster growth and attained greater overall size compared with nonadvanced polyps.

    "abstract": "The CT Colonography Reporting and Data System (C-RADS) has withstood the test of time and proven to be a robust classification scheme for CT colonography (CTC) findings. C-RADS version 2023 represents an update on the scheme used for colorectal and extracolonic findings at CTC. The update provides useful insights gained since the implementation of the original system in 2005. Increased experience has demonstrated confusion on how to classify the mass-like appearance of the colon consisting of soft tissue attenuation that occurs in segments with acute or chronic diverticulitis. Therefore, the update introduces a new subcategory, C2b, specifically for mass-like diverticular strictures, which are likely benign. Additionally, the update simplifies extracolonic classification by combining E1 and E2 categories into an updated extracolonic category of E1/E2 since, irrespective of whether a finding is considered a normal variant (category E1) or an otherwise clinically unimportant finding (category E2), no additional follow-up is required. This simplifies and streamlines the classification into one category, which results in the same management recommendation.",

    "abstract": "Background Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-powered image generation present opportunities to enhance three-dimensional medical images. Diffusion, an iterative denoising process, represents the standard of many of the current tools used for this purpose. Purpose To demonstrate the current capabilities of diffusion technology by using Midjourney, version 5.2, a text-to-image generative AI tool, and present a practical guide for its use. Materials and Methods This exploratory study investigates the principles, parameters, and prompt engineering techniques for generating images focusing on Midjourney from July 27 to August 3, 2023. Step-by-step instructions show the innate capability of this technology in creating realistic medical images. Results Thirty images were selected, including eye, skin, and vascular aneurysm images. Varying prompt phrasing and weighting techniques allowed for the customization of output image characteristics. Although the details of Midjourney's model training are confidential, it is estimated that it was trained on at least hundreds of millions of images from the web. Anatomic fidelity was not always maintained because the training data set is not necessarily based on accurate medical images. There are shortcomings in this nascent technology regarding its ability to create entities such as digits of the hand or precise text. Conclusion AI image generation has the potential to improve three-dimensional medical images for certain applications through added visual detail and appeal but ongoing collaboration is needed between radiologists and AI developers due to the overreliance on art and photography in the training data, which may result in inaccurate anatomic results. Moreover, the evolving landscape of ethical discussions and copyright stipulations warrants close attention. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.",

    "abstract": "Background The impact of waning vaccine effectiveness on the severity of COVID-19-related findings discovered with radiologic examinations remains underexplored. Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines over time against severe clinical and radiologic outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Materials and Methods This multicenter retrospective study included patients in the Korean Imaging Cohort of COVID-19 database who were hospitalized for COVID-19 between June 2021 and December 2022. Patients who had received at least one dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were categorized based on the time elapsed between diagnosis and their last vaccination. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate vaccine effectiveness against a composite of severe clinical outcomes (invasive ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or in-hospital death) and severe radiologic pneumonia (≥25% of lung involvement), and odds ratios (ORs) were compared between patients vaccinated within 90 days of diagnosis and those vaccinated more than 90 days before diagnosis. Results Of 4196 patients with COVID-19 (mean age, 66 years ± 17 [SD]; 2132 [51%] women, 2064 [49%] men), the ratio of severe pneumonia since their most recent vaccination was as follows: 90 days or less, 18% (277 of 1527); between 91 and 120 days, 22% (172 of 783); between 121 and 180 days, 27% (274 of 1032); between 181 and 240 days, 32% (159 of 496); and more than 240 days, 31% (110 of 358). Patients vaccinated more than 240 days before diagnosis showed increased odds of severe clinical outcomes compared with patients vaccinated within 90 days (OR = 1.94 [95% CI: 1.16, 3.24]; P = .01). Similarly, patients vaccinated more than 240 days before diagnosis showed increased odds of severe pneumonia on chest radiographs compared with patients vaccinated within 90 days (OR = 1.65 [95% CI: 1.13, 2.40]; P = .009). No difference in odds of severe clinical outcomes (P = .13 to P = .68) or severe pneumonia (P = .15 to P = .86) were observed between patients vaccinated 91-240 days before diagnosis and those vaccinated within 90 days of diagnosis. Conclusion Vaccine effectiveness against severe clinical outcomes and severe pneumonia related to SARS-CoV-2 infection gradually declined, with increased odds of both observed in patients vaccinated more than 240 days before diagnosis. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Health care access disparities and lack of inclusion in clinical research have been well documented for marginalized populations. However, few studies exist examining the research funding of institutions that serve historically underserved groups. Purpose To assess the relationship between research funding awarded to radiology departments by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Lown Institute Hospitals Index rankings for inclusivity and community benefit. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included radiology departments awarded funding from the NIH between 2017 and 2021. The 2021 Lown Institute Hospitals Index rankings for inclusivity and community benefit were examined. The inclusivity metric measures how similar a hospital's patient population is to the surrounding community in terms of income, race and ethnicity, and education level. The community benefit metric measures charity care spending, Medicaid as a proportion of patient revenue, and other community benefit spending. Linear regression and Pearson correlation coefficients (r values) were used to evaluate the relationship between aggregate NIH radiology department research funding and measures of inclusivity and community benefit. Results Seventy-five radiology departments that received NIH funding ranging from $195 000 to $216 879 079 were included. A negative correlation was observed between the amount of radiology department research funding received and institutional rankings for serving patients from racial and/or ethnic minorities (r = -0.34; P < .001), patients with low income (r = -0.44; P < .001), and patients with lower levels of education (r = -0.46; P < .001). No correlation was observed between the amount of radiology department research funding and institutional rankings for charity care spending (r = -0.19; P = .06), community investment (r = -0.04; P = .68), and Medicaid as a proportion of patient revenue (r = -0.10; P = .22).

    "abstract": "Background Splenic biopsy is rarely performed because of the perceived risk of hemorrhagic complications. Purpose To evaluate the safety of large bore (≥18 gauge) image-guided splenic biopsy. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive adult patients who underwent US- or CT-guided splenic biopsy between March 2001 and March 2022 at eight academic institutions in the United States. Biopsies were performed with needles that were 18 gauge or larger, with a comparison group of biopsies with needles smaller than 18 gauge. The primary outcome was significant bleeding after the procedure, defined by the presence of bleeding at CT performed within 30 days or angiography and/or surgery performed to manage the bleeding. Categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test and medians were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Results A total of 239 patients (median age, 63 years; IQR, 50-71 years; 116 of 239 [48.5%] female patients) underwent splenic biopsy with an 18-gauge or smaller needle and 139 patients (median age, 58 years [IQR, 49-69 years]; 66 of 139 [47.5%] female patients) underwent biopsy with a needle larger than 18 gauge. Bleeding was detected in 20 of 239 (8.4%) patients in the 18-gauge or smaller group and 11 of 139 (7.9%) in the larger than 18-gauge group. Bleeding was treated in five of 239 (2.1%) patients in the 18-gauge or smaller group and one of 139 (1%) in the larger than 18-gauge group. No deaths related to the biopsy procedure were recorded during the study period. Patients with bleeding after biopsy had smaller lesions compared with patients without bleeding (median, 2.1 cm [IQR, 1.6-5.4 cm] vs 3.5 cm [IQR, 2-6.8 cm], respectively; P = .03). Patients with a history of lymphoma or leukemia showed a lower incidence of bleeding than patients without this history (three of 90 [3%] vs 28 of 288 [9.7%], respectively; P = .05). Conclusion Bleeding after splenic biopsy with a needle 18 gauge or larger was similar to biopsy with a needle smaller than 18 gauge and seen in 8% of procedures overall, with 2% overall requiring treatment. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) at dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI of cancer-free breasts increases the risk of developing breast cancer; implications of quantitative BPE in ipsilateral breasts with breast cancer are largely unexplored. Purpose To determine whether quantitative BPE measurements in one or both breasts could be used to predict recurrence risk in women with breast cancer, using the Oncotype DX recurrence score as the reference standard. Materials and Methods This HIPAA-compliant retrospective single-institution study included women diagnosed with breast cancer between January 2007 and January 2012 (development set) and between January 2012 and January 2017 (internal test set). Quantitative BPE was automatically computed using an in-house-developed computer algorithm in both breasts. Univariable logistic regression was used to examine the association of BPE with Oncotype DX recurrence score binarized into high-risk (recurrence score >25) and low- or intermediate-risk (recurrence score ≤25) categories. Models including BPE measures were assessed for their ability to distinguish patients with high risk versus those with low or intermediate risk and the actual recurrence outcome. Results The development set included 127 women (mean age, 58 years ± 10.2 [SD]; 33 with high risk and 94 with low or intermediate risk) with an actual local or distant recurrence rate of 15.7% (20 of 127) at a minimum 10 years of follow-up. The test set included 60 women (mean age, 57.8 years ± 11.6; 16 with high risk and 44 with low or intermediate risk). BPE measurements quantified in both breasts were associated with increased odds of a high-risk Oncotype DX recurrence score (odds ratio range, 1.27-1.66 [95% CI: 1.02, 2.56]; P < .001 to P = .04). Measures of BPE combined with tumor radiomics helped distinguish patients with a high-risk Oncotype DX recurrence score from those with a low- or intermediate-risk score, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94 in the development set and 0.79 in the test set. For the combined models, the negative predictive values were 0.97 and 0.93 in predicting actual distant recurrence and local recurrence, respectively. Conclusion Ipsilateral and contralateral DCE MRI measures of BPE quantified in patients with breast cancer can help distinguish patients with high recurrence risk from those with low or intermediate recurrence risk, similar to Oncotype DX recurrence score. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that enables better contextual understanding of language and efficient training on massive amounts of unlabeled data, such as unstructured text from the internet. As LLMs have increased in size, their improved performance and emergent abilities have revolutionized natural language processing. Since language is integral to human thought, applications based on LLMs have transformative potential in many industries. In fact, LLM-based chatbots have demonstrated human-level performance on many professional benchmarks, including in radiology. LLMs offer numerous clinical and research applications in radiology, several of which have been explored in the literature with encouraging results. Multimodal LLMs can simultaneously interpret text and images to generate reports, closely mimicking current diagnostic pathways in radiology. Thus, from requisition to report, LLMs have the opportunity to positively impact nearly every step of the radiology journey. Yet, these impressive models are not without limitations. This article reviews the limitations of LLMs and mitigation strategies, as well as potential uses of LLMs, including multimodal models. Also reviewed are existing LLM-based applications that can enhance efficiency in supervised settings.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease, with a worldwide prevalence of 25%. NAFLD is a spectrum that includes nonalcoholic fatty liver defined histologically by isolated hepatocytes steatosis without inflammation and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the inflammatory subtype of NAFLD and is associated with disease progression, development of cirrhosis, and increased rates of liver-specific and overall mortality. The differentiation between NAFLD and NASH as well as staging NASH are important yet challenging clinical problems. Liver biopsy is currently the standard for disease diagnosis and fibrosis staging. However, this procedure is invasive, costly, and cannot be used for longitudinal monitoring. Therefore, several noninvasive quantitative imaging biomarkers have been proposed that can estimate the severity of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. Despite this, noninvasive diagnosis of NASH and accurate risk stratification remain unmet needs. In this work, the most relevant available imaging biomarkers are reviewed and their application in patients with NAFLD are discussed.",

    "title": "Age-specific Dose Catalog for Diagnostic Fluoroscopy and Fluoroscopically Guided Interventional Procedures from a Pediatric Hospital.",
    "abstract": "Background Fluoroscopy is an imaging modality associated with a wide range of dose levels, characterized using a variety of dose metrics, including effective dose. However, for clinical procedures, effective dose is a seldom-used and unregulated metric in the United States, and thus, it is not extensively studied in radiology despite potentially large clinical implications for patients, especially children and infants. Purpose To formulate and report a dose catalog across all diagnostic and interventional radiology (IR) fluoroscopy examination or procedure types at a specialized tertiary care pediatric hospital. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, dose metrics taken from radiation dose structured reports of fluoroscopy between October 2014 and March 2023 were analyzed. The reports included fluoroscopy across 18 diagnostic examination types and 24 IR procedure types. The National Cancer Institute dosimetry system for Radiography and Fluoroscopy Monte Carlo software was used to estimate age-specific effective dose from dose-area product (DAP). The DAP-to-effective dose conversion factors were estimated per IR procedure type and diagnostic fluoroscopy examination type based on age. Results A total of 11 536 individual diagnostic fluoroscopy examinations (18 types) and 8017 individual IR procedures (24 types) were analyzed. Median effective dose values per diagnostic fluoroscopy examination type ranged from 0.0010 to 0.44 mSv (mean, 0.0808 mSv ± 0.0998 [SD]). Calculated DAP-to-effective dose conversion factors ranged from 0.04 to 2.48 mSv/Gy · cm2 (mean, 0.758 mSv/Gy · cm2 ± 0.614) across all diagnostic fluoroscopy examination types. Median effective dose values per IR procedure type ranged from 0.0007 to 3.90 mSv (mean, 0.6757 mSv ± 0.8989). Calculated DAP-to-effective dose conversion factors ranged from 0.001 to 0.87 mSv/Gy · cm2 (mean, 0.210 mSv/Gy · cm2 ± 0.235) across all IR procedure types. Conclusion A pediatric fluoroscopy dose catalog was created, including age-specific effective dose, using a repeatable robust method based on accurate clinical data. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Gadolinium Presence in Rat Skin: Assessment of Histopathologic Changes Associated with Small Fiber Neuropathy.",
    "abstract": "Background The presence of gadolinium traces in the skin after administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) raised safety concerns regarding a potential association with small fiber neuropathy (SFN). Purpose To investigate signs of SFN in rat foot pads by quantification of the intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) after multiple GBCA administrations and to evaluate gadolinium concentration, chemical species, and clearance. Materials and Methods Fifty rats received eight intravenous injections of either gadodiamide, gadobutrol, gadoterate, gadoteridol (8 × 0.6 mmol per kilogram of body weight), or saline (1.2 mL per kilogram of body weight), within 2 weeks and were sacrificed 5 days or 5 weeks after the last injection. IENFD was determined with protein gene product (PGP) 9.5 immunofluorescent staining and blinded and automated image analysis. The gadolinium and GBCA concentrations were measured with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), laser ablation ICP-MS, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI). P values were calculated using linear contrasts of model analysis. Results The IENFD (measured as geometric mean [SD] and in number of nerve fibers per millimeter of epidermis) was not significantly altered after 5 days (saline, 8.4 [1.1]; gadobutrol, 9.7 [1.2]; gadoterate, 9.2 [1.2]; gadoteridol, 9.9 [1.3]; gadodiamide, 10.5 [1.2]) or 5 weeks (saline, 19.7 [1.4]; gadobutrol, 16.4 [1.6]; gadoterate, 14.3 [1.6]; gadoteridol, 22.2 [1.8]; gadodiamide, 17.9 [1.4]). Gadolinium skin concentrations were highest for gadodiamide after 5 days (16.0 nmol/g [1.1]) and 5 weeks (10.6 nmol/g [1.2], -33%). Macrocyclic agents were lower at 5 days (gadoteridol, 2.6 nmol/g [1.2]; gadobutrol, 2.7 nmol/g [1.1]; and gadoterate, 2.3 nmol/g [1.2]) and efficiently cleared after 5 weeks (gadoteridol, -95%; gadobutrol and gadoterate, -96%). The distribution of gadolinium and IENF did not visually overlap. For macrocyclic agents, gadolinium was found in sweat glands and confirmed to be intact chelate. Conclusion There were no signs of SFN in rat foot pads using multiple dosing regimens at two time points after administration of GBCAs. Macrocyclic GBCAs exhibited lower levels of gadolinium in the skin and were effectively eliminated within 5 weeks compared with linear gadodiamide, and intact macrocyclic GBCA was detected in sweat glands. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Deep learning (DL)-based MRI reconstructions can reduce imaging times for turbo spin-echo (TSE) examinations. However, studies that prospectively use DL-based reconstructions of rapidly acquired, undersampled MRI in the shoulder are lacking. Purpose To compare the acquisition time, image quality, and diagnostic confidence of DL-reconstructed TSE (TSEDL) with standard TSE in patients indicated for shoulder MRI. Materials and Methods This prospective single-center study included consecutive adult patients with various shoulder abnormalities who were clinically referred for shoulder MRI between February and March 2023. Each participant underwent standard TSE MRI (proton density- and T1-weighted imaging; conventional TSE sequence was used as reference for comparison), followed by a prospectively undersampled accelerated TSEDL examination. Six musculoskeletal radiologists evaluated images using a four-point Likert scale (1, poor; 4, excellent) for overall image quality, perceived signal-to-noise ratio, sharpness, artifacts, and diagnostic confidence. The frequency of major pathologic features and acquisition times were also compared between the acquisition protocols. The intergroup comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results Overall, 135 shoulders in 133 participants were evaluated (mean age, 47.9 years ± 17.1 [SD]; 73 female participants). The median acquisition time of the TSEDL protocol was lower than that of the standard TSE protocol (288 seconds [IQR, 288-288 seconds] vs 926 seconds [IQR, 926-950 seconds], respectively; P < .001), achieving a 69% lower acquisition time. TSEDL images were given higher scores for overall image quality, perceived signal-to-noise ratio, and artifacts (all P < .001). Similar frequency of pathologic features (P = .48 to > .99), sharpness (P = .06), or diagnostic confidence (P = .05) were noted between images from the two protocols. Conclusion In a clinical setting, TSEDL led to reduced examination time and higher image quality with similar diagnostic confidence compared with standard TSE MRI in the shoulder. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background CT-defined visceral pleural invasion (VPI) is an important indicator of prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there is a lack of studies focused on small subpleural NSCLCs (≤30 mm). Purpose To identify CT features predictive of VPI in patients with subpleural NSCLCs 30 mm or smaller. Materials and Methods This study is a retrospective review of patients enrolled in the Initiative for Early Lung Cancer Research on Treatment (IELCART) at Mount Sinai Hospital between July 2014 and February 2023. Subpleural nodules 30 mm or smaller were classified into two groups: a pleural-attached group and a pleural-tag group. Preoperative CT features suggestive of VPI were evaluated for each group separately. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, nodule size, and smoking status was used to determine predictive factors for VPI. Model performance was analyzed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and models were compared using Akaike information criterion (AIC). Results Of 379 patients with NSCLC with subpleural nodules, 37 had subsolid nodules and 342 had solid nodules. Eighty-eight patients (22%) had documented VPI, all in solid nodules. Of the 342 solid nodules (46% in male patients, 54% in female patients; median age, 71 years; IQR: 66, 76), 226 were pleural-attached nodules and 116 were pleural-tag nodules. VPI was more frequent for pleural-attached nodules than for pleural-tag nodules (31% [69 of 226] vs 16% [19 of 116], P = .005). For pleural-attached nodules, jellyfish sign (odds ratio [OR], 21.60; P < .001), pleural thickening (OR, 6.57; P < .001), and contact surface area (OR, 1.05; P = .01) independently predicted VPI. The jellyfish sign led to a better VPI prediction (AUC, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.90). For pleural-tag nodules, multiple tags to different pleura surfaces enabled independent prediction of VPI (OR, 9.30; P = .001). Conclusions For patients with solid NSCLC (≤30 mm), CT predictors of VPI were the jellyfish sign, pleural thickening, contact surface area (pleural-attached nodules), and multiple tags to different pleura surfaces (pleural-tag nodules). © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "title": "Chronic Lung Injury after COVID-19 Pneumonia: Clinical, Radiologic, and Histopathologic Perspectives.",
    "abstract": "With the COVID-19 pandemic having lasted more than 3 years, concerns are growing about prolonged symptoms and respiratory complications in COVID-19 survivors, collectively termed post-COVID-19 condition (PCC). Up to 50% of patients have residual symptoms and physiologic impairment, particularly dyspnea and reduced diffusion capacity. Studies have also shown that 24%-54% of patients hospitalized during the 1st year of the pandemic exhibit radiologic abnormalities, such as ground-glass opacity, reticular opacity, bronchial dilatation, and air trapping, when imaged more than 1 year after infection. In patients with persistent respiratory symptoms but normal results at chest CT, dual-energy contrast-enhanced CT, xenon 129 MRI, and low-field-strength MRI were reported to show abnormal ventilation and/or perfusion, suggesting that some lung injury may not be detectable with standard CT. Histologic patterns in post-COVID-19 lung disease include fibrosis, organizing pneumonia, and vascular abnormality, indicating that different pathologic mechanisms may contribute to PCC. Therefore, a comprehensive imaging approach is necessary to evaluate and diagnose patients with persistent post-COVID-19 symptoms. This review will focus on the long-term findings of clinical and radiologic abnormalities and describe histopathologic perspectives. It also addresses advanced imaging techniques and deep learning approaches that can be applied to COVID-19 survivors. This field remains an active area of research, and further follow-up studies are warranted for a better understanding of the chronic stage of the disease and developing a multidisciplinary approach for patient management.",

    "title": "Present and Future Innovations in AI and Cardiac MRI.",
    "abstract": "Cardiac MRI is used to diagnose and treat patients with a multitude of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the growth of clinical cardiac MRI, complicated image prescriptions and long acquisition protocols limit the specialty and restrain its impact on the practice of medicine. Artificial intelligence (AI)-the ability to mimic human intelligence in learning and performing tasks-will impact nearly all aspects of MRI. Deep learning (DL) primarily uses an artificial neural network to learn a specific task from example data sets. Self-driving scanners are increasingly available, where AI automatically controls cardiac image prescriptions. These scanners offer faster image collection with higher spatial and temporal resolution, eliminating the need for cardiac triggering or breath holding. In the future, fully automated inline image analysis will most likely provide all contour drawings and initial measurements to the reader. Advanced analysis using radiomic or DL features may provide new insights and information not typically extracted in the current analysis workflow. AI may further help integrate these features with clinical, genetic, wearable-device, and \"omics\" data to improve patient outcomes. This article presents an overview of AI and its application in cardiac MRI, including in image acquisition, reconstruction, and processing, and opportunities for more personalized cardiovascular care through extraction of novel imaging markers.",

    "abstract": "Background Multiple commercial artificial intelligence (AI) products exist for assessing radiographs; however, comparable performance data for these algorithms are limited. Purpose To perform an independent, stand-alone validation of commercially available AI products for bone age prediction based on hand radiographs and lung nodule detection on chest radiographs. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was carried out as part of Project AIR. Nine of 17 eligible AI products were validated on data from seven Dutch hospitals. For bone age prediction, the root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient were computed. The reference standard was set by three to five expert readers. For lung nodule detection, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was computed. The reference standard was set by a chest radiologist based on CT. Randomized subsets of hand (n = 95) and chest (n = 140) radiographs were read by 14 and 17 human readers, respectively, with varying experience. Results Two bone age prediction algorithms were tested on hand radiographs (from January 2017 to January 2022) in 326 patients (mean age, 10 years ± 4 [SD]; 173 female patients) and correlated strongly with the reference standard (r = 0.99; P < .001 for both). No difference in RMSE was observed between algorithms (0.63 years [95% CI: 0.58, 0.69] and 0.57 years [95% CI: 0.52, 0.61]) and readers (0.68 years [95% CI: 0.64, 0.73]). Seven lung nodule detection algorithms were validated on chest radiographs (from January 2012 to May 2022) in 386 patients (mean age, 64 years ± 11; 223 male patients). Compared with readers (mean AUC, 0.81 [95% CI: 0.77, 0.85]), four algorithms performed better (AUC range, 0.86-0.93; P value range, <.001 to .04). Conclusions Compared with human readers, four AI algorithms for detecting lung nodules on chest radiographs showed improved performance, whereas the remaining algorithms tested showed no evidence of a difference in performance. © RSNA, 2024 Supplemental material is available for this article.

    "abstract": "Background Pulmonary noncalcified nodules (NCNs) attached to the fissural or costal pleura with smooth margins and triangular or lentiform, oval, or semicircular (LOS) shapes at low-dose CT are recommended for annual follow-up instead of immediate workup. Purpose To determine whether management of mediastinal or diaphragmatic pleura-attached NCNs (M/DP-NCNs) with the same features as fissural or costal pleura-attached NCNs at low-dose CT can follow the same recommendations. Materials and Methods This retrospective study reviewed chest CT examinations in participants from two databases. Group A included 1451 participants who had lung cancer that was first present as a solid nodule with an average diameter of 3.0-30.0 mm. Group B included 345 consecutive participants from a lung cancer screening program who had at least one solid nodule with a diameter of 3.0-30.0 mm at baseline CT and underwent at least three follow-up CT examinations. Radiologists reviewed CT images to identify solid M/DP-NCNs, defined as nodules 0 mm in distance from the mediastinal or diaphragmatic pleura, and recorded average diameter, margin, and shape. General descriptive statistics were used. Results Among the 1451 participants with lung cancer in group A, 163 participants (median age, 68 years [IQR, 61.5-75.0 years]; 92 male participants) had 164 malignant M/DP-NCNs 3.0-30.0 mm in average diameter. None of the 164 malignant M/DP-NCNs had smooth margins and triangular or LOS shapes (upper limit of 95% CI of proportion, 0.02). Among the 345 consecutive screening participants in group B, 146 participants (median age, 65 years [IQR, 59-71 years]; 81 female participants) had 240 M/DP-NCNs with average diameter 3.0-30.0 mm. None of the M/DP-NCNs with smooth margins and triangular or LOS shapes were malignant after a median follow-up of 57.8 months (IQR, 46.3-68.1 months). Conclusion For solid M/DP-NCNs with smooth margins and triangular or LOS shapes at low-dose CT, the risk of lung cancer is extremely low, which supports the recommendation of Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2022 for annual follow-up instead of immediate workup. © RSNA, 2024 See also the editorial by Goodman and Baruah in this issue.",

    "abstract": "While musculoskeletal imaging volumes are increasing, there is a relative shortage of subspecialized musculoskeletal radiologists to interpret the studies. Will artificial intelligence (AI) be the solution? For AI to be the solution, the wide implementation of AI-supported data acquisition methods in clinical practice requires establishing trusted and reliable results. This implementation will demand close collaboration between core AI researchers and clinical radiologists. Upon successful clinical implementation, a wide variety of AI-based tools can improve the musculoskeletal radiologist's workflow by triaging imaging examinations, helping with image interpretation, and decreasing the reporting time. Additional AI applications may also be helpful for business, education, and research purposes if successfully integrated into the daily practice of musculoskeletal radiology. The question is not whether AI will replace radiologists, but rather how musculoskeletal radiologists can take advantage of AI to enhance their expert capabilities.",

    "title": "Quantification of Emphysema Progression at CT Using Simultaneous Volume, Noise, and Bias Lung Density Correction.",
    "abstract": "Background CT attenuation is affected by lung volume, dosage, and scanner bias, leading to inaccurate emphysema progression measurements in multicenter studies. Purpose To develop and validate a method that simultaneously corrects volume, noise, and interscanner bias for lung density change estimation in emphysema progression at CT in a longitudinal multicenter study. Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of the prospective Genetic Epidemiology of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPDGene) study, lung function data were obtained from participants who completed baseline and 5-year follow-up visits from January 2008 to August 2017. CT emphysema progression was measured with volume-adjusted lung density (VALD) and compared with the joint volume-noise-bias-adjusted lung density (VNB-ALD). Reproducibility was studied under change of dosage protocol and scanner model with repeated acquisitions. Emphysema progression was visually scored in 102 randomly selected participants. A stratified analysis of clinical characteristics was performed that considered groups based on their combined lung density change measured by VALD and VNB-ALD. Results A total of 4954 COPDGene participants (mean age, 60 years ± 9 [SD]; 2511 male, 2443 female) were analyzed (1329 with repeated reduced-dose acquisition in the follow-up visit). Mean repeatability coefficients were 30 g/L ± 0.46 for VALD and 14 g/L ± 0.34 for VNB-ALD. VALD measurements showed no evidence of differences between nonprogressors and progressors (mean, -5.5 g/L ± 9.5 vs -8.6 g/L ± 9.6; P = .11), while VNB-ALD agreed with visual readings and showed a difference (mean, -0.67 g/L ± 4.8 vs -4.2 g/L ± 5.5; P < .001). Analysis of progression showed that VNB-ALD progressors had a greater decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (-42 mL per year vs -32 mL per year; Tukey-adjusted P = .002). Conclusion Simultaneously correcting volume, noise, and interscanner bias for lung density change estimation in emphysema progression at CT improved repeatability analyses and agreed with visual readings. It distinguished between progressors and nonprogressors and was associated with a greater decline in lung function metrics. Clinical trial registration no.
